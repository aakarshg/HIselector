38344,Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska,"['Denied coverage of needed surgery , currently blue cross blue shield is denying my wife coverage of a necessary surgery that could keep her out of a wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are now.', 'Worst health insurance ever, bcbs of nm bought lovelace with whom i was insured and i was assured the coverage would be the same. this company attempted to force me to have surgery done by an incompetent doctor instead of allowing me to go out of network to a qualified surgeon as my urologist/oncologist recommended to them in writing. i changed to united health care and have been happy. the people that work in their claims office are incompetent. you get a different person every time you contact them and you get a different answer as to why your claim has not been paid. this is not the old bcbs from a few years ago. these people are some of the worst in the health care industry.', 'Poor customer service/long waits, ive been hung up on. yelled at. transferred countless times across their departments. i have to get my id number every single time i talk to someone, and i usually have to talk between 5 different employees just to get a simple answer. im stuck with bcbs, but damn they need to improve how they handle and treat customers that call in.', 'The worst insurance company, the coverage is very expensive and dont cover anything. they will always argue about coverage and will try to get away with it. i feel not safe being with this company.', 'Terrible wont cover anything, why waste your money i have a premium plan and anything i get prescribed gets denied. they are legal thief and liars i pay 1200 a month for nothing go elsewhere terrible !!!', 'Costing to much monthly, can not afford this blue cross and blue shield any longer. $23,000.00 yearly is to costly for us.', 'Worse customer service than the cable company, i decided to switch my policy this year with bcbs, because the policy i previously had with bcbs increased by $90 per month and the coverage was not as good. i did it through the exchange, never received a bill, never received insurance cards, it takes over an hour to get a hold of anyone. generally they cannot find my info. next year i will be switching to another company this is outrageous!!!!', 'Never again, ive had bcbs for years. never had a problem until coming to south carolina. they denied a claim for 6 months without reason, just sent a denial, and finally when pressed - claimed i wasnt a covered individual. strange considering they had premiums from my paycheck for 9 months...finally when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and i have filed an appeal - bcbs says 3-6 months before a decision. i cant help but feel like they are hoping i will just die before they have to provide coverage.', 'Self plus one - same cost as family, i switched from family option to self plus one and the cost is 12 dollars less a month! unbelievable! and they advertise this as something new! i have been paying 460dollars plus my company matches the same amount - so almost 1000 dollars for no 12 years! premiums too high plus deductible. cannot wait to change the provider in the open season.', 'Horrible service, 1. they wont change your address even if you put it in writing and mail it. 2. they terminated my insurance after a member service representative informed me i was renewed. 3. i never got a call from a supervisor as i told i was going to . it is to painful to go on. on just plain insensitive ,horrible and out of integrity.', 'Forced into hmo, no providers, only individual policy offered in 2016 was an hmo, last year i had a ppo with bcbs. none of my specialists take hmos. its a crime to have to pay outrageous insurance premiums $664.00 a month, for an individual plan, then have to pay again out of pocket to see a specialist. i will never use bcbs again.', 'Bcbs, i was a member of trs active as a teacher. since i took early retirement, i do not qualify for their continued insurance even though i worked 20 years. their policies are way too expensive for me now.', 'Horrible coverage/service, the website is horribly complicated. it is impossible to find out what my plan covers or dose not unless you have the medical codes for everything and you call in. the customer service is slow and i have been told completely different things by different representatives. every time you call customer service be prepared to spend 40-60+ minutes on the phone. even if its something simple.', 'I hate bcbs, blue cross blue shield is the worst health insurance company i have ever had. although my back is a mess and i have spurs from the crumbling disks jabbing into my spinal cord.... which is causing pain and numbness down my left leg, bcbs denied the claim..... piss poor company......', 'Worse, lying, expensive insurance company, they are over priced, and the suck at communication. there deductible is super high that why they dont have to pay. when trying to file my claims i called and the agent told me to go online and get the claim form. i filed my claims twice and they sent me a rejection letter twice saying my information was incorrect, when calling again the agent told me they changed the paperwork and to file you have to take it to were you got your stuff done and have the doctor sign. when doing that (took me two days, since i work 6 days a week and had to travel all around town, and figuring when they work to get them signed), the agent gave me her personal email to send her the information which was the beginning of december. she told me to allow 30 days to file. i got in touch with her in january wondering the status, she said she had to file the docs again because the computer didnt scan them in correctly, and again wait 30 days, i called in the beginning of february, she went on to tell me that her computer crashed and lost all my info, (which it could have happen) thats why she didnt reach out to me, if i could resend her all the claims again, and wait another 30 days, in the beginning of march i got in touch with the agent and she told me that two of them went towards my deductible and the other one was paid. when asking for her to give me a statement so i could file thru my secondary insurance, she told me thats not necessary, and i told her if you were secondary for another customer wouldnt you want prove the other insurance didnt pay? she didnt get back to me for 10 minutes, so i called and talked to a different lady, and she sent it to me in 5 minutes. the original lady sent the paperwork the next day in the afternoon.when i tried to file the two claims that went towards my deductible, my other insurance was asking why was the claims put in march 2nd. so this whole time they were lying to me saying it was put in. when on record it was put in last week.', 'Sham on blue cross blue shield, blue cross blue sheld more then doubled their rates, and offer the worst insurance coverage ever, their deductables are high, out of pocket high, why have insurance when you pay for everything yourself. their $600.00 a month policy is now $1,700.00 a month. sham sham', 'Isitusal, i took the best policy offered by my employer because i am a cancer survivor and testing is expensive. i also am being treated for depression and the meds i am prescribed are very expensive. however, the cost of just under $105.00 per week is to hard to keep up with along with my co-pays.', 'Ive learned i should pay a little more out of poc, im still seeking insurance that fits my budget.this company has good coverage but am paying a higher premium than i need because i dont have serious health conditions.', 'I always thought this was the best, but the monthly premiums are expensive and now that i am on senior care it seems to cover less than it once did.', 'Decent coverage but controlling, they switched my medication without going through my doctor due to it being cheaper for them. the new medication is not as effective and they declined my switch back to the old medication. currently appealing it.', 'Service sucks!!, i have been having some troubles with ordering prescriptions. the pharmacist wants to charge me 400 bucks after my deductible has been made. i have contacted bcbs several times and nothing has been done. they told me they would have it fixed yesterday, but no one called back. i left 3 messages yesterday with the case manager. can you help? any suggestions? case manager: bonita valles 401-459-5534 case number 4769-20mar17 so, as you can see, the case started on march 20th, but i actually called them a few days before that and they gave me an incomplete case number. i have psoriasis and it gets worse when i cant get my meds and if i get frustrated! well, i am frustrated. i am at the point where i need to get lawyers involved or go to channel 12 or 10.', 'Very costly', 'I detest this co but it is better than my last, clear your entire day if you need to get info from empire bc bs. it is very expensive insurance, you do not get to see the doctors you would like to see (hmo) and dealing with customer service is frustrating at best. you remain on hold forever and are transferred to three different people who put you on hold forever and it leaves such a bad taste in your mouth.', 'Dishonest and very stressful, last month, i noticed an increase in my premium so i called customer service. a seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it. its about more than saving a few dollars now. at this point this is all about whats right and this is not', 'Wish there was a zero star, my brother was in a horrible car accident had 7 surgeries and now he is in rehab hospital dr recommended at least a month in rehab, after 5 days of rehab blue cross said he is ok to go home after there retarded dr mckinsey read his medical records , stupid dr it is obvious you never went to med school my brother can not walk or turn on his own he has tubes hanging out of his stomach, he can barely move 7 surgeries stupid dr mckinsey a 5 year old could have

month. i only make $1400.00 a month. it is no longer feasible for me to carry this coverage.', 'Blue shield special care, i love having special care because i dont earn enough to afford anything else. now that the affordable care act is coming in to play, i am losing special care which covered my hystorectomy 100%. i just hope i can find something very similar with no deductable and let me keep my family doctor', 'My insurance company, i was very happy with bcbs but they use to take my excellent health status into consideration. now they do not and my monthly bill will be going up 178%. i cant afford to stay on this plan with that amount per month. i have only been to the hospital once in my life and that was for a ruptured appendix and take one generic medication. otherwise, i am very healthy,and i hate to say this, for my age. they have been very good whenever i have had a question or concern, but the cost is too much as i am unemployed at the moment. i have been going to a gym for 34 years and eat right. i rarely see the doctor and i only see one these days for preventative medicine procedures. i find it sad that i have done everything right in my life and now i have to pay more for it. i probably will not be staying with bcbs because of the cost.', 'Need health coverage, turning age 26 years of age on december 11. 2013 and will no longer have coverage under my mothers

of about $150-!60 per mo. and the pdp plan than was an option for an addl cost. these were medicare add-on plans. for 2014 i switched to the bluechip $0 $0 $0 plan. little did i know that during 2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the problem still exists for me and others like me because immunos are not handled like other meds by the insurance co.s it is difficult to find which plan covers what. and just to confuse things further throw obamacare into the mix. dazed and confused.....joe g.', 'Bc/bs, i have always enjoyed bc/bs insurance even when i lived in ri. it seems to be accepted in a lot of states that i am associated

at $25.00 for generic drugs. it is my hope that mr. trump will do what he says he will do and allow every insurance company to sell in every state and that should bring down the cost because they will be competing with each other. in a day when not having insurance is not an option blue cross thinks they can charge what they want. (its because they can. people who will not work simply because they dont want to get insurance free or at a very low price. i believe everyone has the right to affordable insurance but just because i work and make $80,000 a year should not make me have to spend 11.24% or 9,000 of it on insurance. i pay my taxes approximately 28 % plus insurance is 39.24% of my wages and i have not even paid a bill but people that will not work get free or very low cost housing, free food and health care. please dont thing that i dont understand that we have people that can not work for different reasons and i believe we should help but make them take drug text and if fit to work make them work!! now back to the big insurance. how much profit should a public service company be allowed to make. our

every month which they have no problem with taking. i guess they would rather pay thousands of dollars for total knee replacement and 3 days inpatient hospitalization than pay for an injection that does not require a hospital stay. also claims are processed incorrectly- i fought for 8 months to have claims reprocessed because they kept denying claims staying providers were out of network. took 8

yrs with them, with individual coverage. i would have quit them long ago, but sometimes you fear what u dont know, especially because this is about my health. finally quit because of medicare age. i cancelled prior to going on medicare but they withdrew a payment from my bank anyways. automated payments work for them, but they cant return my money by direct deposit. dont have it yet. not transparent because their website doesnt tell me about what is covered, never has. if i ever questioned what coverage i had, they took many calls before sending me any info. last time they sent me coverage info for an affordable healthcare plan, but did not cover me as such, denied claim. when i call about prescription cost, they tell me it will cost so much, but at the pharmacist it is a different cost. prior to the affordable healthcare act, my premiums went up 50% in 2 yrs. while aha was being negotiated, it only went up 1%. interesting at best! after it went up, this last yr it went up 14%, $130 more each month. i thinks it takes a long time when calling because they have so many options and plans that even they dont know whats going on. not transparent on coverage, not trustworthy on many things. glad its over. everyone deserves healthcare, and it should be single payer.', 'Not satisfied with bcbs, i wanted to go for outside university check up but the deductible

2 months, still no resolution. we cant even get them to put in writing for us that there system is broken, and we have approval to see this doctor. the customer service transfers us around, takes notes, tells us they will call back, never call back, then it dies. we resurrect it every week. the latest is this: we called a ton of ent specialists listed on their site, and none of them take

negative to infinity. they word their auto draft agreement so they can take premium out of your account. you think you are agreeing to an amount, but you actually just give them authority to take

that you have actually requested by email such as your premium is going up over $1000. you are required to renew stuff yearly, yet they dont have to get an actual consistent from you to wipe out your entire bank account, taking out over what you make monthly. over drawing you by $500 and leaving high and dry. they refuse to make it right stating there was extra crap we were supposed to fill out

her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same

coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math?

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math?

sometimes five or more times for a single claim. sometimes all records of a claim mysteriously disappeared, and aetna said they had no idea what had happened. in these cases, i forwarded them my confirmations of the submissions and they asked me to re-submit everything from scratch since they didnt know what had gone wrong. in other cases, ive had claims which were processed, approved, and supposedly paid out, but cant find any payment corresponding to the date on which they claimed to have paid. when ive asked for confirmation of where the money was sent, they didnt know and said theyd have to investigate. in other cases, payments did come through, but without a clear reference to identify which claims they corresponded to, and aetnas own people couldnt identify which payments corresponded to which claims. this isnt a trivial problem when youre working with foreign currencies whose exchange rates fluctuate. if i submit a claim in yen or euros, its not clear what the corresponding value will be in usd when the reimbursement reaches my us account. and since they sometimes pay out multiple claims in a single lump, this makes it even harder to identify without a detailed reference. ive also encountered numerous cases where they messed up the claim date, leading to further confusion. aetna international is based in the us, but forms submitted abroad typically have the date format reversed (dd/mm). one would think an insurer that caters specifically to expats would have this figured out, but no. if i visit the doctor on april 8, odds are high that theyll

me to the thesis that they are unwilling to pay for claims if even the smallest technical problem is seen on the referral or a prescription is very expensive...in which case they require pre-authorization that is impossible to get approved in time in emergency situations (and backdating for reimbursements is a pasquinade to lure you into their premiums). for example, i recently needed a pre-authorization for a prescription that i paid for in an emergency. they take >48 hours to approve pre-auths, even in emergency situations. so, after about a week, i called member services. they told me that my pre-authorization had been approved! yay! however, they wanted me to call the specialty pharmacy to backdate the pre-auth. the rep sounded so genuinely surprised that i was approved that i called him out on it. though he was very nice, told me that he could not help me backdate the pre-auth, and that i should call the pre-auth number. when i did, i was told that there is no record i ever had a pre-auth and that i should call member services. so having come full circle, i called member services and reminded the representative that i had already called 3, and that i was told two days prior that my pre-auth was pending; one day prior i was told (surprisingly) that i was approved; and today i was told no such authorization was ever submitted by the doctor on my behalf. the subterfuge escalated, and i was told there was nobody available to help him find the missing record. he said he would call me back and he never did. i paid $1500 for my medication for the second

me to the thesis that they are unwilling to pay for claims if even the smallest technical problem is seen on the referral or a prescription is very expensive...in which case they require pre-authorization that is impossible to get approved in time in emergency situations (and backdating for reimbursements is a pasquinade to lure you into their premiums). for example, i recently needed a pre-authorization for a prescription that i paid for in an emergency. they take >48 hours to approve pre-auths, even in emergency situations. so, after about a week, i called member services. they told me that my pre-authorization had been approved! yay! however, they wanted me to call the specialty pharmacy to backdate the pre-auth. the rep sounded so genuinely surprised that i was approved that i called him out on it. though he was very nice, told me that he could not help me backdate the pre-auth, and that i should call the pre-auth number. when i did, i was told that there is no record i ever had a pre-auth and that i should call member services. so having come full circle, i called member services and reminded the representative that i had already called 3, and that i was told two days prior that my pre-auth was pending; one day prior i was told (surprisingly) that i was approved; and today i was told no such authorization was ever submitted by the doctor on my behalf. the subterfuge escalated, and i was told there was nobody available to help him find the missing record. he said he would call me back and he never did. i paid $1500 for my medication for the second

coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

ever with unitedhealthcare. during the year 2015, i was covered by aetna health care and i would say that i had a pleasant experience with them. unfortunately, my employer made a contract with united healthcare, choice plus plan at the beginning of 2016 and that was the beginning of the nightmare to every employee. what happens (half the time) is that they will decline the claims and then, you will have to fight to get them to pay for basic covered services by your plan. they will request information from you and they will claim that they have not received anything so they do not pay and will continue to do that until you give up and pay it yourself. since the beginning of 2016 until today, i spent more than $6000 from my own pocket for claims which unitedhealthcare refused to pay because i have not provided them with the requested information from january until today :). if you can find another insurance then, do not hesitate ever, this is the advice from my providers.', 'Bait and switch, beware of uhone. although it terms itself united health care (individual health policies), these policies are actually administered by golden rule insurance, which is known for providing more limited coverage and has more restrictive networks. the uhone policy claims to use the uhc choice plus network, but only once you sign up do you find out that their version of this network, although named the same, has a more restrictive provider list than other uhc choice plus networks. now you are locked in for a year with less coverage than you thought you were paying for. also, you have to pay for all drugs up front and submit bills for them to reimburse later. dont trust what their customer service reps tell you--i have had 4 different people mislead me in the same way as their

trips to the pharmacy, after 3 weeks i had to give up on. optumrx doesnt accept electronically submitted scripts from university of california davis, medical center? of the 2 remaining prescriptions, 1 is not covered at all ($1296.00) for a 90-day supply and the 5th, (last) prescription is not eligible for mail-order? my out-of pocket prescription costs went from $120 a month at my local grocery store to over $1400 a month with my own coupons at 2 different locations. the only money and time saved is at uhcs end. they dont have to do anything, which i am sure suits them just fine, collect my premiums and provide no services? if you want to pay for your own prescriptions and clip coupons to redeem at multiple locations this is your company! if you want prescription drug coverage i strongly urge you to look elsewhere, this company is slow to respond, cherry picks what is and is not covered, and in the long run the policyholder pays much more out of pocket. the medical portion of coverage i can not yet comment on, aside from the co-pay is 33% higher for a family practice office visit. thankfully i was not due for my annual screening labs and mammogram. summary: i would be better served

programs. i had to already pay $640.00 out of my own pocket for this program to meet my out of pocket maximum and i dont know how im going to be able to pay for the 11 remaining sessions. this is very frustrating i have always felt that i had the best health insurance around that cared about its customers. but in this instance they clearly do not. they pay to get my started and well into my

made record profits this year because this is how they treat their members: charge them outrageous premiums, refuse to pay when members need to use their insurance; drop hospitals, facilities, and

They kept me going through tons of red tape and hearings I didnt request only to keep denying me my meds. NO more Kaiser for us. We are leaving and going to a new health plan.

36096,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois,"['Denied coverage of needed surgery , currently blue cross blue shield is denying my wife coverage of a necessary surgery that could keep her out of a wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are now.', 'Worst health insurance ever, bcbs of nm bought lovelace with whom i was insured and i was assured the coverage would be the same. this company attempted to force me to have surgery done by an incompetent doctor instead of allowing me to go out of network to a qualified surgeon as my urologist/oncologist recommended to them in writing. i changed to united health care and have been happy. the people that work in their claims office are incompetent. you get a different person every time you contact them and you get a different answer as to why your claim has not been paid. this is not the old bcbs from a few years ago. these people are some of the worst in the health care industry.', 'Poor customer service/long waits, ive been hung up on. yelled at. transferred countless times across their departments. i have to get my id number every single time i talk to someone, and i usually have to talk between 5 different employees just to get a simple answer. im stuck with bcbs, but damn they need to improve how they handle and treat customers that call in.', 'The worst insurance company, the coverage is very expensive and dont cover anything. they will always argue about coverage and will try to get away with it. i feel not safe being with this company.', 'Terrible wont cover anything, why waste your money i have a premium plan and anything i get prescribed gets

the coverage was not as good. i did it through the exchange, never received a bill, never received insurance cards, it takes over an hour to get a hold of anyone. generally they cannot find my info. next year i will be switching to another company this is outrageous!!!!', 'Never again, ive had bcbs for years. never had a problem until coming to south carolina. they denied a claim for 6 months without reason, just sent a denial, and finally when pressed - claimed i wasnt a covered individual. strange considering they had premiums from my paycheck for 9 months...finally when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and i have filed an appeal - bcbs says 3-6 months before a decision. i cant help but feel like they are hoping i will just die before they have to provide coverage.', 'Self plus one - same cost as family, i switched from family option to self plus one and the cost is 12 dollars less a month! unbelievable! and they advertise this as something new! i have been paying 460dollars plus my company matches

expensive insurance company, they are over priced, and the suck at communication. there deductible is super high that why they dont have to pay. when trying to file my claims i called and the agent told me to go online and get the claim form. i filed my claims twice and they sent me a rejection letter twice saying my information was incorrect, when calling again the agent told me they changed the paperwork and to file you have to take it to were you got your stuff done and have the doctor sign. when doing that (took me two days, since i work 6 days a week and had to travel all around town, and figuring when they work to get them signed), the agent gave me her personal email to send her the information which was the beginning of december. she told me to allow 30 days to file. i got in touch with her in january wondering the status, she said she had to file the docs again because the computer didnt scan them in correctly, and again wait 30 days, i called in the beginning of february, she went on to tell me that her computer crashed and lost all my info, (which it could have happen) thats why she didnt reach out to me, if i could resend her all the claims again, and wait another 30 days, in the beginning of march i got in touch with the agent and she told me that two of them went towards my deductible and the other one was paid. when asking for her to give me a statement so i could file thru my secondary insurance, she told me thats not necessary, and i told her if you were secondary for another customer wouldnt you want prove the other insurance didnt pay? she didnt get back to me for 10 minutes, so i called and talked to a different lady, and she sent it to me in 5 minutes. the original lady sent the paperwork the next day in the afternoon.when i tried to file the two claims that went towards my deductible, my other insurance was asking why was the claims put in march 2nd. so this whole time they were lying to me saying it was put in. when on record it was put in last week.', 'Sham on blue cross blue shield, blue cross blue sheld more then doubled their rates, and offer the worst insurance coverage ever, their deductables are high, out of pocket

seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

settlement why do i even pay for insurance. i had neck surgery prior with bcbs as my employee sponsored insurance and they took at 69% discount so why now you just want your profits because you know we cant do shit about it, hope your family has this problem one day.', 'Incompetence , this is the worst insurance company i have ever seen!!!!!! they complicate the most simple things such as picking up a monthly prescription. there is always some sort of complication that can never be solved immediately or even in a reasonable time period. these issues are repetitive, this insurance company is

yrs with them, with individual coverage. i would have quit them long ago, but sometimes you fear what u dont know, especially because this is about my health. finally quit because of medicare age. i cancelled prior to going on medicare but they withdrew a payment from my bank anyways. automated payments work for them, but they cant return my money by direct deposit. dont have it yet. not transparent because their website doesnt tell me about what is covered, never has. if i ever questioned what coverage i had, they took many calls before sending me any info. last time they sent me coverage info for an affordable healthcare plan, but did not cover me as such, denied claim. when i call about prescription cost, they tell me it will cost so much, but at the pharmacist it is a different cost. prior to the affordable healthcare act, my premiums went up 50% in 2 yrs. while aha was being negotiated, it only went up 1%. interesting at best! after it went up, this last yr it went up 14%, $130 more each month. i thinks it takes a long time when calling because they have so many options and plans that even they dont know whats going on. not transparent on coverage, not

2 months, still no resolution. we cant even get them to put in writing for us that there system is broken, and we have approval to see this doctor. the customer service transfers us around, takes notes, tells us they will call back, never call back, then it dies. we resurrect it every week. the latest is this: we called a ton of ent specialists listed on their site, and none of them take

negative to infinity. they word their auto draft agreement so they can take premium out of your account. you think you are agreeing to an amount, but you actually just give them authority to take

that you have actually requested by email such as your premium is going up over $1000. you are required to renew stuff yearly, yet they dont have to get an actual consistent from you to wipe out your entire bank account, taking out over what you make monthly. over drawing you by $500 and leaving high and dry. they refuse to make it right stating there was extra crap we were supposed to fill out

her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are

without reason, just sent a denial, and finally when pressed - claimed i wasnt a covered individual. strange considering they had premiums from my paycheck for 9 months...finally when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and i have filed an appeal - bcbs says 3-6 months before a decision. i cant help but feel like they are hoping i will just die before they have to provide coverage.', 'Self plus one - same cost as family,

the paperwork and to file you have to take it to were you got your stuff done and have the doctor sign. when doing that (took me two days, since i work 6 days a week and had to travel all around town, and figuring when they work to get them signed), the agent gave me her personal email to send her the information which was the beginning of december. she told me to allow 30 days to file. i got in touch with her in january wondering the status, she said she had to file the docs again because the computer didnt scan them in correctly, and again wait 30 days, i called in the beginning of february, she went on to tell me that her computer crashed and lost all my info, (which it could have happen) thats why she didnt reach out to me, if i could resend her all the claims again, and wait another 30 days, in the beginning of march i got in touch with the agent and she told me that two of them went towards my deductible and the other one was paid. when asking for her to give me a statement so i could file thru my secondary insurance, she told me thats not necessary, and i told her if you were secondary for another customer wouldnt you want prove the other insurance didnt pay?

seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are now.', 'Worst health insurance ever, bcbs of nm bought lovelace with whom i was insured and i was assured the coverage would be the same. this company attempted to force me to have surgery done by an

the people that work in their claims office are incompetent. you get a different person every time you contact them and you get a different answer as to why your claim has not been paid. this is not

claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

the paperwork and to file you have to take it to were you got your stuff done and have the doctor sign. when doing that (took me two days, since i work 6 days a week and had to travel all around town, and figuring when they work to get them signed), the agent gave me her personal email to send her the information which was the beginning of december. she told me to allow 30 days to file. i got in touch with her in january wondering the status, she said she had to file the docs again because the computer didnt scan them in correctly, and again wait 30 days, i called in the beginning of february, she went on to tell me that her computer crashed and lost all my info, (which it could have happen) thats why she didnt reach out to me, if i could resend her all the claims again, and wait another 30 days, in the beginning of march i got in touch with the agent and she told me that two of them went towards my deductible and the other one was paid. when asking for her to give me a

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in

me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several

in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math?

NO! Im not stupid and know Arthritis and TMJ do not resolve. They are permanant conditions and lab tests etc. are NOT necessary for these conditions. They only want me to come in and pay the MUCH higher than before co-pays to run tests that are not necessary and are worthless as far as my conditions.

another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will

seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

of it is my 600 dollar medication comes out to 100 dollars, however, that is limited before they raise your price, never notify you about the change then expect you to be okay with it after you call in. this is just one of my many problems i have had. i dont think bcbs really cares about its customers, they know we are in need of our medication yet they take our money and offer us the bare minium

keep her out of a wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are now.', 'Worst health insurance ever, bcbs of nm bought lovelace with whom i was insured and i was assured the coverage would be the same. this company attempted to force me to have

when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and i have filed an appeal - bcbs says 3-6 months before a decision. i cant help but feel like they are hoping i will just die before they have to provide coverage.', 'Self plus one

customer service. a seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they

pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the problem still exists for me and others like me because immunos are not handled like other meds by the insurance co.s it is difficult to find which plan covers what.

some of this but they are not solely to blame. i could not in good conscience work at, nor recommend united to anyone. find a provider that offers flexibility. by this i mean things like, no pre-approval, a full sleep study, ice machine after surgery, longer stay time in a care facility, seeing a doc daily or when needed as inpatient, getting the right amount physical therapy instead of a set number of days, and medication that is consistent ( even generic meds can change monthly because the pharmacy will buy from a different manufacturer- the medication is equivalent but not the same and can have unfortunate effects.). these are just some of the things that you will be missing and you wont even know it until you need them. united healthcare is the worst worst worst worst. dont use it, not even as supplemental.', 'Worst insurance ever!!! , i got stuck with this plan united health care and it is horrible they hardly cover shit and no one accepts them i woyld never in my life

doctors, and if they need to run some test. united healthcare only covers about 50% of the costs. do not use this insurance unless it is your only option, like most other insurance companies they are

gram to see if the money order possibly got lost. the money order was listed as outstanding on the 8th. on august 18th i called money gram again and the same money order that they had not received was listed as being cashed on the 9th of august, the day after i told her they wouldnt be getting any more money from me. coincidence? i think not. i think they were just hoping id repay! do not do

healthcare, choice plus plan at the beginning of 2016 and that was the beginning of the nightmare to every employee. what happens (half the time) is that they will decline the claims and then, you will have to fight to get them to pay for basic covered services by your plan. they will request information from you and they will claim that they have not received anything so they do not pay and will continue to do that until you give up and pay it yourself. since the beginning of 2016 until today, i spent more than $6000 from my own pocket for claims which unitedhealthcare refused to pay

although named the same, has a more restrictive provider list than other uhc choice plus networks. now you are locked in for a year with less coverage than you thought you were paying for. also, you have to pay for all drugs up front and submit bills for them to reimburse later. dont trust what their customer service reps tell you--i have had 4 different people mislead me in the same way as their

are the same price with or without insurance (i used a coupon, rather than submitting through insurance, for a better price). the mail order feature that could save you hundreds of dollars a year, and trips to the pharmacy, after 3 weeks i had to give up on. optumrx doesnt accept electronically submitted scripts from university of california davis, medical center? of the 2 remaining prescriptions, 1 is not covered at all ($1296.00) for a 90-day supply and the 5th, (last) prescription is not eligible for mail-order? my out-of pocket prescription costs went from $120 a month at my local grocery store to over $1400 a month with my own coupons at 2 different locations. the only money and time saved is at uhcs end. they dont have to do anything, which i am sure suits them just fine, collect my premiums and provide no services? if you want to pay for your own prescriptions and clip coupons to redeem at multiple locations this is your company! if you want prescription drug coverage i strongly urge you to look elsewhere, this company is slow to respond, cherry picks what is and is not covered, and in the long run the policyholder pays much more out of pocket. the medical portion of coverage i can not yet comment on, aside from the co-pay is 33% higher for a family practice office visit. thankfully i was not due for my annual screening labs and mammogram. summary: i would be better served

an inpatient program and they wouldnt approve more than 19 sessions. my program director said that this is common with united healthcare and they often deny full coverage for substance abuse recovery programs. i had to already pay $640.00 out of my own pocket for this program to meet my out of pocket maximum and i dont know how im going to be able to pay for the 11 remaining sessions. this is very frustrating i have always felt that i had the best health insurance around that cared about its customers. but in this instance they clearly do not. they pay to get my started and well into my

made record profits this year because this is how they treat their members: charge them outrageous premiums, refuse to pay when members need to use their insurance; drop hospitals, facilities, and doctors mid-year so members are forced to pay uhc and pay out-of-pocket to doctors. uhc is unethical; they force you to hold their insurance a year, yet they drop your doctors and hospitals soon after

will have to fight to get them to pay for basic covered services by your plan. they will request information from you and they will claim that they have not received anything so they do not pay and will continue to do that until you give up and pay it yourself. since the beginning of 2016 until today, i spent more than $6000 from my own pocket for claims which unitedhealthcare refused to pay

claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct,

in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math?

transparent because their website doesnt tell me about what is covered, never has. if i ever questioned what coverage i had, they took many calls before sending me any info. last time they sent me coverage info for an affordable healthcare plan, but did not cover me as such, denied claim. when i call about prescription cost, they tell me it will cost so much, but at the pharmacist it is a different cost. prior to the affordable healthcare act, my premiums went up 50% in 2 yrs. while aha was being negotiated, it only went up 1%. interesting at best! after it went up, this last yr it went up 14%, $130 more each month. i thinks it takes a long time when calling because they have so many options and plans that even they dont know whats going on. not transparent on coverage, not trustworthy on many things. glad its over. everyone deserves healthcare, and it should be single payer.', 'Not satisfied with bcbs, i wanted to go for outside university check up but the deductible

32753,Healthy Alliance Life Co(Anthem BCBS),"['Signed up for MegaLife + NASE policy when I became self-employed. Rarely used the policy even for preventative services initially but still paid the separate $200-$300 monthly premium to ML and $40 monthly fee to NASE. When I cancelled my policy, was told that the ~$1000 for claims and ~$850 in prescription fees exceeded the amount that was accumulated in the so-called Return of Premium feature and so was not eligible for any refunds of premium. So of the $18,000 that I paid to Mega alone, I send in $1000 of claims and $850 of prescriptions and Im not eligible for a premium return? I also have the receipts for the other thousands of dollars in claim fees and lab fees and other services that they didnt pay for so this plan actually cost me closer to $30,000.

her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same

claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

11512,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of NC,"['Denied coverage of needed surgery , currently blue cross blue shield is denying my wife coverage of a necessary surgery that could keep her out of a wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are now.', 'Worst health insurance ever, bcbs of nm bought lovelace with whom i was insured and i was assured the coverage would be the same. this company attempted to force me to have surgery done by an incompetent doctor instead of allowing me to go out of network to a qualified surgeon as my urologist/oncologist recommended to them in writing. i changed to united health care and have been happy. the people that work in their claims office are incompetent. you get a different person every time you contact them and you get a different answer as to why your claim has not been paid. this is not the old bcbs from a few years ago. these people are some of the worst in the health care industry.', 'Poor customer service/long waits, ive been hung up on. yelled at. transferred countless times across their departments. i have to get my id number every single time i talk to someone, and i usually have to talk between 5 different employees just to get a simple answer. im stuck with bcbs, but damn they need to improve how they handle and treat customers that call in.', 'The worst insurance company, the coverage is very expensive and dont cover anything. they will always argue about coverage and will try to get away with it. i feel not safe being with this company.', 'Terrible wont cover anything, why waste your money i have a premium plan and anything i get prescribed gets denied. they are legal thief and liars i pay 1200 a month for nothing go elsewhere terrible !!!', 'Costing to much monthly, can not afford this blue cross and blue shield any longer. $23,000.00 yearly is to costly for us.', 'Worse customer service than the cable company, i decided to switch my policy this year with bcbs, because the policy i previously had with bcbs increased by $90 per month and the coverage was not as good. i did it through the exchange, never received a bill, never received insurance cards, it takes over an hour to get a hold of anyone. generally they cannot find my info. next year i will be switching to another company this is outrageous!!!!', 'Never again, ive had bcbs for years. never had a problem until coming to south carolina. they denied a claim for 6 months without reason, just sent a denial, and finally when pressed - claimed i wasnt a covered individual. strange considering they had premiums from my paycheck for 9 months...finally when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and i have filed an appeal - bcbs says 3-6 months before a decision. i cant help but feel like they are hoping i will just die before they have to provide coverage.', 'Self plus one - same cost as family, i switched from family option to self plus one and the cost is 12 dollars less a month! unbelievable! and they advertise this as something new! i have been paying 460dollars plus my company matches the same amount - so almost 1000 dollars for no 12 years! premiums too high plus deductible. cannot wait to change the provider in the open season.', 'Horrible service, 1. they wont change your address even if you put it in writing and mail it. 2. they terminated my insurance after a member service representative informed me i was renewed. 3. i never got a call from a supervisor as i told i

specialist. i will never use bcbs again.', 'Bcbs, i was a member of trs active as a teacher. since i took early retirement, i do not qualify for their continued insurance even though i worked 20

the medical codes for everything and you call in. the customer service is slow and i have been told completely different things by different representatives. every time you call customer service be prepared to spend 40-60+ minutes on the phone. even if its something simple.', 'I hate bcbs, blue cross blue shield is the worst health insurance company i have ever had. although my back is a mess

expensive insurance company, they are over priced, and the suck at communication. there deductible is super high that why they dont have to pay. when trying to file my claims i called and the agent told me to go online and get the claim form. i filed my claims twice and they sent me a rejection letter twice saying my information was incorrect, when calling again the agent told me they changed the paperwork and to file you have to take it to were you got your stuff done and have the doctor sign. when doing that (took me two days, since i work 6 days a week and had to travel all around town, and figuring when they work to get them signed), the agent gave me her personal email to send her the information which was the beginning of december. she told me to allow 30 days to file. i got in touch with her in january wondering the status, she said she had to file the docs again because the computer didnt scan them in correctly, and again wait 30 days, i called in the beginning of february, she went on to tell me that her computer crashed and lost all my info, (which it could have happen) thats why she didnt reach out to me, if i could resend her all the claims again, and wait another 30 days, in the beginning of march i got in touch with the agent and she told me that two of them went towards my deductible and the other one was paid. when asking for her to give me a statement so i could file thru my secondary insurance, she told me thats not necessary, and i told her if you were secondary for another customer wouldnt you want prove the other insurance didnt pay? she didnt get back to me for 10 minutes, so i called and talked to a different lady, and she sent it to me in 5 minutes. the original lady sent the paperwork the next day in the afternoon.when i tried to file the two claims that went towards my deductible, my other insurance was asking why was the claims put in march 2nd. so this whole time they were lying to me saying it was put in. when on record it was put in last week.', 'Sham on blue cross blue shield, blue cross blue sheld more then doubled their rates, and offer the worst insurance coverage ever, their deductables are high, out of pocket

people who put you on hold forever and it leaves such a bad taste in your mouth.', 'Dishonest and very stressful, last month, i noticed an increase in my premium so i called customer service. a seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it. its about more than saving a few dollars now. at this point this is all about whats right and this is not', 'Wish there was a zero star, my brother was in a horrible car accident had 7 surgeries and

of about $150-!60 per mo. and the pdp plan than was an option for an addl cost. these were medicare add-on plans. for 2014 i switched to the bluechip $0 $0 $0 plan. little did i know that during 2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

37160,Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota,"['Denied coverage of needed surgery , currently blue cross blue shield is denying my wife coverage of a necessary surgery that could keep her out of a wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are now.', 'Worst health insurance ever, bcbs of nm bought lovelace with whom i was insured and i was assured the coverage would be the same. this company attempted to force me to have surgery done by an incompetent doctor instead of allowing me to go out of network to a qualified surgeon as my urologist/oncologist recommended to them in writing. i changed to united health care and have been happy. the people that work in their claims office are incompetent. you get a different person every time you contact them and you get a different answer as to why your claim has not been paid. this is not the old bcbs from a few years ago. these people are some of the worst in the health care industry.', 'Poor customer service/long waits, ive been hung up on. yelled at. transferred countless times

next year i will be switching to another company this is outrageous!!!!', 'Never again, ive had bcbs for years. never had a problem until coming to south carolina. they denied a claim for 6 months without reason, just sent a denial, and finally when pressed - claimed i wasnt a covered individual. strange considering they had premiums from my paycheck for 9 months...finally when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and i have filed an appeal - bcbs says 3-6 months before a decision. i cant help but feel like they are hoping i will just die before they have to provide coverage.', 'Self plus one - same cost as family,

told me to go online and get the claim form. i filed my claims twice and they sent me a rejection letter twice saying my information was incorrect, when calling again the agent told me they changed the paperwork and to file you have to take it to were you got your stuff done and have the doctor sign. when doing that (took me two days, since i work 6 days a week and had to travel all around town, and figuring when they work to get them signed), the agent gave me her personal email to send her the information which was the beginning of december. she told me to allow 30 days to file. i got in touch with her in january wondering the status, she said she had to file the docs again because the computer didnt scan them in correctly, and again wait 30 days, i called in the beginning of february, she went on to tell me that her computer crashed and lost all my info, (which it could have happen) thats why she didnt reach out to me, if i could resend her all the claims again, and wait another 30 days, in the beginning of march i got in touch with the agent and she told me that two of them went towards my deductible and the other one was paid. when asking for her to give me a statement so i could file thru my secondary insurance, she told me thats not necessary, and i told her if you were secondary for another customer wouldnt you want prove the other insurance didnt pay? she didnt get back to me for 10 minutes, so i called and talked to a different lady, and she sent it to me in 5 minutes. the original lady sent the paperwork the next day in the afternoon.when i tried

seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

73751,Medica Health Plans,"['When I was healthy, Medica was great. It covered the few prescriptions I had and my annual exams. Then, I had back surgery. Suddenly, they stopped knowing how to do paperwork. I heard various and sundry excuses for nine months following my surgery as to why they had not yet paid Mayo Clinic what they were supposed to pay them. First, they were really backed up. Then, my claim was incorrectly auto-adjudicated. The most recent one Ive heard is that they arent paying their own bills! They have (had?) a contract with Mayo, and since they havent been paying what theyre supposed to, Mayo is balanced billing me. Over the past nine months, I have spoken to twelve different Medica employees, a few of them on more than one occasion. Each of them has been very cordial but apparently very limited in their ability to help their clients, as I am STILL dealing with this problem nine months later. I cant help but wonder if they are hoping Ill be sent to collections by the clinic so that it wont be their problem anymore. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for several months; I should not have to give benefits to my insurance company. Last I heard, it was supposed to be the other way around.']"
89364,Sanford Health Plan,"['Signed up for MegaLife + NASE policy when I became self-employed. Rarely used the policy even for preventative services initially but still paid the separate $200-$300 monthly premium to ML and $40 monthly fee to NASE. When I cancelled my policy, was told that the ~$1000 for claims and ~$850 in prescription fees exceeded the amount that was accumulated in the so-called Return of Premium feature and so was not eligible for any refunds of premium. So of the $18,000 that I paid to Mega alone, I send in $1000 of claims and $850 of prescriptions and Im not eligible for a premium return? I also have the receipts for the other thousands of dollars in claim fees and lab fees and other services that they didnt pay for so this plan actually cost me closer to $30,000. It would have been a better deal for me to pay completely out of pocket for all of my medical expenses rather than give them $16,000 for services not rendered. THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY. THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT. And NASEs representation of them means that NASE is also a scam. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS before it costs you more than it did me.']"

wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are

without reason, just sent a denial, and finally when pressed - claimed i wasnt a covered individual. strange considering they had premiums from my paycheck for 9 months...finally when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

of about $150-!60 per mo. and the pdp plan than was an option for an addl cost. these were medicare add-on plans. for 2014 i switched to the bluechip $0 $0 $0 plan. little did i know that during 2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the problem still exists for me and others like me because immunos are not handled like other meds by the insurance co.s it is difficult to find which plan covers what. and just to confuse things further

Its horrible to navigate and paying your bill online is virtually impossible. It never recognizes my username and password and the policy number ON MY DOCUMENTATION from American National is NEVER recognized on their site. So I called several times to pay my premium and couldnt hold any longer on all calls (held for more than 30 minutes on each). Finally MAILED a check still in good time. Took them WEEKS to cash the check but finally they did. Then they sent me a letter telling me that my insurance was canceled pending reinstatement. I called again hoping to reinstate over the phone and held for 47 minutes. When I finally got through I was told reinstatement couldnt be done over the phone but once they received my forms I should (hopefully) be reinstated within a MONTH. Thanks for NOTHING. They should get their money back from their web designer except he/she probably got paid in 1994 for their work and no updates have been done since then.']

We had been with Molina for many years, and were shocked to find that Amerigroup was involved now. I have a severely disabled daughter. I was very disturbed to find out that Amerigroup did not pay for a therapy provider that my daughter had been covered for almost five years through other Medicaid managed care plans. We do get to change back to Molina effective the first of next month, which does cover this therapist and many other useful providers. I also found that Amerigroup has very few general practice providers either. The pediatric clinic where my daughter has been going (with other Medicaid managed care plans) for nearly 14 years, isnt covered by Amerigroup either. I have looked on the internet since finding out about Amerigroup, and see that plenty of other people report having crappy experiences with them as well. If you have ANY other choice for a Medicaid plan, you should probably reject Amerigroup and chose another provider. I am in Washington, and it appears that Amerigroup handles everything out of Virginia. You will probably do much better with a Medicaid plan like Molina, which has MANY years of successful work in Washington (and many other states) and at least has a local office in Washington (and probably in all or most of the other states that they serve as well).']"

her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are

claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

Suddenly, they stopped knowing how to do paperwork. I heard various and sundry excuses for nine months following my surgery as to why they had not yet paid Mayo Clinic what they were supposed to pay them. First, they were really backed up. Then, my claim was incorrectly auto-adjudicated. The most recent one Ive heard is that they arent paying their own bills! They have (had?) a contract with Mayo, and since they havent been paying what theyre supposed to, Mayo is balanced billing me. Over the past nine months, I have spoken to twelve different Medica employees, a few of them on more than one occasion. Each of them has been very cordial but apparently very limited in their ability to help their clients, as I am STILL dealing with this problem nine months later. I cant help but wonder if they are hoping Ill be sent to collections by the clinic so that it wont be their problem anymore. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for several months; I should not have to give benefits to my insurance company. Last I heard, it was supposed to be the other way around.']"

When I cancelled my policy, was told that the ~$1000 for claims and ~$850 in prescription fees exceeded the amount that was accumulated in the so-called Return of Premium feature and so was not eligible for any refunds of premium. So of the $18,000 that I paid to Mega alone, I send in $1000 of claims and $850 of prescriptions and Im not eligible for a premium return? I also have the receipts for the other thousands of dollars in claim fees and lab fees and other services that they didnt pay for so this plan actually cost me closer to $30,000. It would have been a better deal for me to pay completely out of pocket for all of my medical expenses rather than give them $16,000 for services not rendered. THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY.

another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will

seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

of about $150-!60 per mo. and the pdp plan than was an option for an addl cost. these were medicare add-on plans. for 2014 i switched to the bluechip $0 $0 $0 plan. little did i know that during 2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

I have had an RX for a pain med and muscle relaxer for years, which was used only as needed and sparingly. I was sent a notice recently that they had assigned me a new Dr. after years of seeing the old one who never gave me a problem with refills. I recently sent in a refill request for my meds and the request was denied saying I had to come in for lab tests and an evaluation to determine if I actually had the condition and or if it still existed What??? NO! Im not stupid and know Arthritis and TMJ do not resolve. They are permanant conditions and lab tests etc. are NOT necessary for these conditions. They only want me to come in and pay the MUCH higher than before co-pays to run tests that are not necessary and are worthless as far as my conditions.

39424,"Moda Health Plan, Inc.","['Innovation Health in general is awful. The ONLY thing they are good at is figuring out how NOT to pay for services. They think using jazzy language and having bubbly graphics on their website makes them an effective insurance company, but they are wrong. Dont get sick out of state. They wont pay for any of it. Dont go to the ER out of state. They wont pay for it. Even if a hospital has Aetna, dont be fooled: if the hospital does not specifically say Innovation Health/Aetna, then they wont cover you. You have to live your entire life in Northern Virginia, or they wont cover you. (Or live in a bubble if you travel.) Dont even get sick past Mary Washington Hospital in Fburg. They wont cover you. Their deductibles are a little much for individuals. And when they negotiate a rate, they will only apply the negotiated rate to your deductible whether or not the hospital accepts it. (Say, for example, the hospital charges me 1,000 dollars for a procedure, and Innovation health assumes a negotiated rate will be 650, but you get a bill for 1,000, anyway. Innovation Health will only apply the 650 to your deductible, because, in their magical, pretend world, that is what they believe is fair. This is way, way too much bull for a plan.

mothers house flooded after broken pipe and she has been out of her house for 7 months and still not back in yet. they wanted her to settle on 14000.00. plus they dont want to give her living expense because she is living with my sister. no where in the policy does it say anything about you wont get this living expense if you stay with relative s. this company is the biggest rip off insurance company i have every seen. my mother ended up getting a public adjuster and this russell guy with hartford got pissed off and he has done nothing but drag his feet on everythin, hold a grudge and make things worse for my mother. on top of everything he said there was no reason why my mother could not have live in her house why waiting for everything to settle. russell would you let your mother live in a house with no flooring, musty smell because it has taken so long for you to get your s__t together and make this right. if you total up all the premium s that my parents have paid to hartford over the 50 something years they have been with them there should not have been any questions about fixing her house. what a piece of crap company, dont do business with them and especially russell he is the biggest con artist. what a joke. i will make sure too post reviews on every social network site about how horrible this company is and how horribly russell handles everything. but when your

been made, and we live in area that is not subject to hurricanes or floods. i explained that i thought an increase of this size should be explained. the response was that they sent out the premium notice 45 days in advance of the due date. but he had no explanation for the increase. i told him that i wanted to know why, because my policy states that the liability portion of the policy could be raised by the amount of inflation for our area, and inflation is less than 1%. after putting me on hold to check my policy his reply was that all policies went up uniformly due to company wide claims. again i asked why that wasnt explained in the premium notification. he couldnt give me an answer. i told him this will be the last time they receive a premium from me. this type of business practice

bottom they add this exclusions. then i asked her what was covered by our policy, she answered: i can not answer your question. it all depends on what happens. now i am really confused as what the

car for almost 2 hours, i called the towing company to get an eta for pickup and they informed me that since i did not have towing on my auto policy, hartford canceled the tow - but hartford didnt tell me they canceled it. i dont want to leave my car in a parking lot over the weekend but hartford refuses to accept any responsibility until their adjuster makes a determination on monday. they

refund any of the money overpaid even though they admit it was their fault when we added the original solar panels 5 years ago. it makes me wonder how they will respond if we have an actual claim. we

sustained to my dwelling, structures, and contents as a result of a hail storm that occurred on 5/27/15. the assessment of damages provided by the hartford insurance company were substantially lower than the damages identified by the adjuster and certified hiaag roof inspector from the claims assistance team. based on the report by the claims assistance team, there were many items either missed by the hartford adjuster and donan engineering. given the overwhelming evidence from the claim assistance team and the threat of taking this issue to the state’s department of insurance, the hartford had no choice but to award me the full amount of my request. by being persistent on my request, obtaining a second opinion, and not taking the first offer, i was able to increase my recovery from $7600.00 to $27,500.00.', 'Just another greedy insurance company, i have been with the hartford for 15 years i had a problem with a payment going through due to my debit card being replaced with a new card i paid it on the 2nd of february. i was not aware that the old card number was on the site the payment was not honored due to the change. my policy was canceled immediately because of this misunderstanding when i called the hartford on the 19th of february to re-instate after i got a letter from them dated february 11th they would not re-instate unless i paid the full balance for the whole year of close to $500.00 i asked if i could make a payment or even half of the amount they said no because i did not contact them soon enough. remember the letter was dated the 11th of february which means it still needed to be mailed so the 13thor 14th it would have arrived. so 7 days or under is the time frame that you are supposed to contact them i guess. i have never had an accident or any problems always paid my bill, again customer 15 years. in the past if there was a problem with a credit card it was no problem to reinstate and take the monthly payment (which happened once before a few years ago) lucky i had a credit card or else i would have not been able to reinstate the policy and been left without insurance. this is totally unreasonable as i started with the policy because of aarp thus hartford deals with older people that may not be able to contact them in the time frame of under a week due to illness or family illness plus most older people are on a fixed income and may not be able to pay the whole year off. i dont know what happened with this company they used to be caring but not any more they are now nothing more than another greedy insurance company that cares more for profit then for people needless to say after this i will not be continuing with the hartford and will not recommend anyone else to do business with them.', 'Late and lousey coverage, it took ten days for hartford to get and adjustor out to even look at the car. once they did, it took so long to get the paperwork for payment that my car rental expired, my car sat ready for pick-up but

hartford but they still said i was 100 percent at fault. i asked how do i appeal this decision. i was told there was nothing more they could do. if this review could prevent one person from making the

asked why i always got some bogus excuse. also when i wanted to insure my near beach house my request was denied because it was too risky. and this year my house insurance jump by almost $300 and they said just because they are not making enough money? so i found another insurance and i am saving several hundreds $$ per year with better coverage. please shop around - this insurance is rip off after you stay with them for few years.', 'They love to take your money!, a company can be great at servicing your policy (making changes, etc.), but you dont really know how the company operates until you

never got a bill for. they never called, never confirmed, never sent me a bill. i take great pride in my credit and paying my bills on time. this was an insult to say the least. if you want to be

manager did not help. i offered to pay the full balance on the spot... no dice... keep in mind that my father religiously paid his bills for many years, and was never late previously. a call to my own agent with travelers, and a few emailed documents, got us a policy in a couple of hours with slightly higher limits and $200 lower premium. they actually did us a favor, but i hope that the

please note that no where in hartfords advertisement does it make reference to matt mccoy being an actor and producer. as a non-professional actor and director, by virtue of his profession, the ad bears credulity of whether he is a believer of what he is saying, or merely acting the role of a long time customer, who is reading a script placed before him, for which he is either getting paid or receiving a free insurance policy. he, along with supposed other long time customers give a plethora of kudos, including how you will never be dropped. firstly, for the sake of being politically correct, i shall simply say - that is a bold-face lie. additionally, if and when they do not cancel your policy, they end up screwing you so badly with outrageous rates, that, instead of them dropping you, you are forced to drop them. for years, i had not only my home, but as many as four vechicles insured by them. upon a second accident, (they claimed three), my auto insurance was doubled. in attempting, on several occasions, to resolve this matter, it became abundantly apparent that a policy that is not theirs, is that the customer is always right or even partially right. until i was able to do research, and find a company who truly advertises and lives up to what they offer, i remained with har(ip)tfo(ff)d. upon finding one, i faxed to them all policy papers from hartford, expressed that i wanted a quote on the exact, same coverage. two thousand dollars less in cost, i am more that happy to say that i have found a company who promises what they will give, and give what they promise. they are friendly, unlike many of the hartford representatives, south ends of horses traveling north, with whom i dealt, they are reputable, they are affordable! in the meantime, i am also

mans insurance company & since he was at fault & received 2 citations proving as much, ive been going through them to fix my vehicle. i am absolutely astounded by the poor quality of their customer service and the underhanded manipulative ways they keep trying to cheap out of fixing my car. i cant believe how unhelpful and downright rude my claims representative is. they still refuse to put an original manufacturers bumper on my 2011 car. they insist an after market bumper is all they will cover despite a significant decrease in safety to my vehicle. research suggests only oem parts should be put on cars, due to the precise nature of crash zones designed to protect life and limb in the event of a crash. my husband and i would like to try and have a baby in the near future, and the idea of putting my perfect newborn child in the backseat of my car without all the safety standards that made me purchase my car in the first place makes me cringe. if you are ever unfortunate enough to be in an accident, know this company will willingly, knowingly, sacrifice your safety for their bottom line. as i research, ive also come across many consumer affairs complaints accusing them of bilking

and nothing for income lost. hartford has admitted they are responsible for income lost, but now putting us through the hoops of requiring multiple income tax filings, a/r for years, etc. we have electronic billing and serial dated pictures of repairs, so simple to show how long it took to get back to full operation and how much income lost. hartford is just delaying final payment as long as possible-damage occurred 17 months ago. hopefully resolved in next six months; if not, will have to file a bad faith claim against them. if you are dealing with hartford, save yourself some time and

supply them the same information four different times. they kept having computer errors requiring me to resubmit a lengthy set of answers. they paid the claim correctly. the second car claim was hail damage which they handled well. the third claim was on our house for the same hail storm that damaged our car. we had multiple contractors verify hail damage. several of our neighbors had new roofs put on due to this storm. i could visually see divots in the shingles. hartford said their was hail damage to some flashing and gutters (and obviously to my car which was in the driveway) but miraculously my roof was spared damage. we contested. their only accepted process was for them to hire a forensic engineer who inspected the roof and, surprise, agreed with the company that was paying their bill. we asked for an independent inspector and they refused. low cost insurance is not all that good if you cant get them to honor their agreed to coverage.', 'Was cancelled after 1 year with

weakest. they hope you dont fight back so they can keep your money.', 'Lousy service, ambiguous rules, i have 4 policies with hartford - 2 homes and 2 vehicles have been insured with this company for over a decade. during that time i have made 2 claims. neither were very big. both were for water leaks in a rental property but the claims process for each claim was unpleasant and ugly. the attitude was like how dare you submit a claim. the last one was so bad i ended up giving a 3 star (out of 5) rating for the service (the claim wasnt closed yet but i still received an email asking for a rating). well, that was a big mistake. after i submitted that rating the claims agent took the review intensly personal and just plain stonewalled everything. i ended up calling the supervisor three times ovet two months before i actually siuceeded in finally settling that claim and getting the work completed. recently i bought another house. i called hartford to ask for a quote. long story short, after over an hour and a half on the phone i was told that they would decline to offer insurance on the new house because it had a wood burning stove and i couldnt produce a certifcate that the stove had been professionally installed and inspected. decline to insure??? there was a dozen better ways to handle this: they could have simply asked that i get an inspection certificate!! or they could have asked me to sign a legally binding document committing to have it removed by a certain date! but instead they just summarilly declared that they were declining the business. my escrow is supposed to close in two days and will be postponed if i cant demonstrate adequate insurance. i will survive this, but no thanks to hartford. i have already found another company that i am confident will be much less expensive over the long run. and i will be transferring all my policies to the new company where they might acctually appreciate my business.', 'Excellent service, i am a salon owner

Took them WEEKS to cash the check but finally they did. Then they sent me a letter telling me that my insurance was canceled pending reinstatement. I called again hoping to reinstate over the phone and held for 47 minutes.

requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of

when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i

their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased

correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they

31195,Sanford Health Plan,"['Signed up for MegaLife + NASE policy when I became self-employed. Rarely used the policy even for preventative services initially but still paid the separate $200-$300 monthly premium to ML and $40 monthly fee to NASE. When I cancelled my policy, was told that the ~$1000 for claims and ~$850 in prescription fees exceeded the amount that was accumulated in the so-called Return of Premium feature and so was not eligible for any refunds of premium. So of the $18,000 that I paid to Mega alone, I send in $1000 of claims and $850 of prescriptions and Im not eligible for a premium return? I also have the receipts for the other thousands of dollars in claim fees and lab fees and other services that they didnt pay for so this plan actually cost me closer to $30,000. It would have been a better deal for me to pay completely out of pocket for all of my medical expenses rather than give them $16,000 for services not rendered. THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY. THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT. And NASEs representation of them means that NASE is also a scam. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS before it costs you more than it did me.']"

wheelchair in the future. their initial reasoning has the surgery not necessary. the surgeon and her personal doctor seemed to differ with blue cross blue shields initial assessment. we have requested her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical compound of cortisone. yet they still deny coverage. i recommend finding a company that has a proven history of covering necessary surgeries. or you could be left out in the cold like we are

the people that work in their claims office are incompetent. you get a different person every time you contact them and you get a different answer as to why your claim has not been paid. this is not

claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

ask why since even the hospital has never had this before but they wont give me any information. they knew i would have to pay them back so they did this even though this will take most of my

transparent because their website doesnt tell me about what is covered, never has. if i ever questioned what coverage i had, they took many calls before sending me any info. last time they sent me coverage info for an affordable healthcare plan, but did not cover me as such, denied claim. when i call about prescription cost, they tell me it will cost so much, but at the pharmacist it is a different cost. prior to the affordable healthcare act, my premiums went up 50% in 2 yrs. while aha was being negotiated, it only went up 1%. interesting at best! after it went up, this last yr it went up 14%, $130 more each month. i thinks it takes a long time when calling because they have so many options and plans that even they dont know whats going on. not transparent on coverage, not

records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same chemical

claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were

times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several

in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the problem still exists for me and others like me because immunos are not handled like other meds by the insurance co.s it is difficult to find which plan covers what. and just to confuse things further

her records and been told that it takes 30 days to get them to us. her surgeon has also made appeals. but they are still wont cover it. now they are stating that she hasnt gone through physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of the same

claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i am sick. my doctor and

charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were

times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

of about $150-!60 per mo. and the pdp plan than was an option for an addl cost. these were medicare add-on plans. for 2014 i switched to the bluechip $0 $0 $0 plan. little did i know that during 2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

93187,Aetna Life Insurance Company,"['Terrible, aetna was one of several choices provided by my employer in this location. i have used them for several years now and i am very disappointed by their claims coverage and customer service. they repeatedly denied claims for services that should be covered (example: pt after surgery - that one should be a no-brainer). i have spent an unbelievable amount of time on the phone and in writing trying unsuccessfully to appeal denials. every time i call about a denied claim, the rep gives me a different story. twice i have filed all the required paperwork, gone through the appeals, been informed that the claim would be covered - only to have the decision reversed again down the line. their strategy seems to be to wear down the customer. in summary, aetna is the best advertisement for a single-payer system that i can think of. if you have any alternative - dont use them.', 'Utterly inconvenient-lame good for nothing coverag, so far....i have paid more than $5000 to doctors out of pocket. this company takes painfully long period to review the case once the patients file is sent for it. i have been calling them since around june to send my case for the review. its end of september now and i found out today that the case had still not been sent because a document was required and pending....which was faxed to them twice almost two months ago and it was confirmed over the phone that it has been received. anyway the agent put me on hold and then came back with the information that document was available with them in the system but the case for review was just not forwarded. i was obviously annoyed and asked why....the agent couldnt kept her cool and said she can only tell me what the system says and theres nothing she can do and that she cant speak for what the previous agents had been telling me. so... two more months if the report actually gets sent....and if it does and if the review is completed in next two months id have waited 5 months just for the review. and if i still after a couple of months find out report was sent for review id have to wait another couple of months because that just is how long it takes for the review process and verifications to complete...and i fear they are going to cover hardly anything the way they have been going about it so far...once the process does get completed....', 'Doesnt cover much, aside from the copay already being pretty high ($50) a visit, the insurance didnt cover much. ive had to have different doctors resubmit regular preventative care tests several times just to still end up with a large bill.', 'Appalling, unforgivably bad claims process, ive been insured twice with aetna international while working abroad (first in south africa, then in japan). while the website has evolved somewhat over time, the claims process remains absolutely abysmal. virtually every claim i filed was mishandled in some way and required follow-up, sometimes five or more times for a single claim. sometimes all records of a claim mysteriously disappeared, and aetna said they had no idea what had happened. in these cases, i forwarded them my confirmations of the submissions and they asked me to re-submit everything from scratch since they didnt know what had gone wrong. in other cases, ive had claims which were processed, approved, and supposedly paid out, but cant find any payment corresponding to the date on which they claimed to have paid. when ive asked for confirmation of where the money was sent, they didnt know and said theyd have to investigate. in other cases, payments did come through, but without a clear reference to identify which claims they corresponded to, and aetnas own people couldnt identify which payments corresponded to which claims. this isnt a trivial problem when youre working with foreign currencies whose exchange rates fluctuate. if i submit a claim in yen or euros, its not clear what the corresponding value will be in usd when the reimbursement reaches my us account. and since they sometimes pay out multiple claims in a single lump, this makes it even harder to identify without a detailed reference. ive also encountered numerous cases where they messed up the claim date, leading to further confusion. aetna international is based in the us, but forms submitted abroad typically have the date format reversed (dd/mm). one would think an insurer that caters specifically to expats would have this figured out, but no. if i visit the doctor on april 8, odds are high that theyll input it as august 4 instead.', 'Ffff, sold policy after speaking to rep. told all meds were covered. they were but it was cheaper to buy without etna insurance. was also told my doctor was in

your own risk.', 'Antiquated and incompetent processes, #1 issue: ongoing since january 2016 is that aetna network management indicates to my provider his reimbursement is $80-84; yet aetna continues to process claims only paying provider $55. week after week, month after month, aetna has not resolved this issue. #2 issue: really takes a long time to dispute claims, have claims reviewed, re-processed; something that should only take a few days takes 2-3 months or more. #3 issue: customer service reps are so nice, making promises to assist, yet you get no where. customer service reps really can not do a thing for you. #4 issue: claims backlog for first three months of the year; eobs not mailed or uploaded on portal. eobs and claims are never processed real time, but run 30-45 days. eobs upload turn of the month and may be 1-2 months behind. corrected eobs do not ever show up on the portal, only the first claim entry, first eob, is posted, not any revised ones. #5 the right

pre-authorization that is impossible to get approved in time in emergency situations (and backdating for reimbursements is a pasquinade to lure you into their premiums). for example, i recently needed a pre-authorization for a prescription that i paid for in an emergency. they take >48 hours to approve pre-auths, even in emergency situations. so, after about a week, i called member services. they

told two days prior that my pre-auth was pending; one day prior i was told (surprisingly) that i was approved; and today i was told no such authorization was ever submitted by the doctor on my behalf. the subterfuge escalated, and i was told there was nobody available to help him find the missing record. he said he would call me back and he never did. i paid $1500 for my medication for the second

it was not through the market place. when i called in january to pay his premium payment and was told his policy was cancelled. for the same reason they told me it wasnt affected. i tried to get a new policy quoted and got the run around being transferred all over then told someone would call me. meanwhile my son who takes medication monthly was without insurance and i was told we are sorry that you were given incorrect information and we do have that recorded but there is nothing we can do. so we suffer. luckily i was able to put him on my insurance at work although it is costing me double

12028,Innovation Health Insurance Company,"['Innovation Health in general is awful. The ONLY thing they are good at is figuring out how NOT to pay for services. They think using jazzy language and having bubbly graphics on their website makes them an effective insurance company, but they are wrong. Dont get sick out of state. They wont pay for any of it. Dont go to the ER out of state. They wont pay for it. Even if a hospital has Aetna, dont be fooled: if the hospital does not specifically say Innovation Health/Aetna, then they wont cover you. You have to live your entire life in Northern Virginia, or they wont cover you. (Or live in a bubble if you travel.) Dont even get sick past Mary Washington Hospital in Fburg. They wont cover you. Their deductibles are a little much for individuals. And when they negotiate a rate, they will only apply the negotiated rate to your deductible whether or not the hospital accepts it. (Say, for example, the hospital charges me 1,000 dollars for a procedure, and Innovation health assumes a negotiated rate will be 650, but you get a bill for 1,000, anyway. Innovation Health will only apply the 650 to your deductible, because, in their magical, pretend world, that is what they believe is fair. This is way, way too much bull for a plan.

seemingly nice lady told me it was for 2017. i asked if it was for 2017 why did i have to pay one for 2016. the customer service representative had told me that it was a mistake on their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this month were still for the new 2017, so i called to see why. the representative this time was unhelpful, he was confused most of the time, kept repeating the same information to me even after i told him several times that what he was telling me had nothing to do with my questions. it was stressful. the guy told me in the most round-about-way why i must pay my 2017 premium this month, and repeatedly kept avoiding my concerns. according to the new representative, the other representative i talked to (the lady) was wrong! you pay a month in advance. i am new to insurances, so this may be the correct, maybe this guy lied, i dont know. but someone lied to me. and i wanted someone to look into my conversation with the lady. i asked him if blue shield records conversations, he said yes after several attempts to avoid this question. but here is the best part, my previous conversation with the lady was not recorded. how convenient. he said he looked it up and doesn’t see a recording. she didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they dealt with it.

2012+13 blue cross was picking up a $365 monthly co-pay for my immuno-surpressant meds. before choosing the bluechip $0 0 0 plan i carefully examined every monthly pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the

Rarely used the policy even for preventative services initially but still paid the separate $200-$300 monthly premium to ML and $40 monthly fee to NASE. When I cancelled my policy, was told that the ~$1000 for claims and ~$850 in prescription fees exceeded the amount that was accumulated in the so-called Return of Premium feature and so was not eligible for any refunds of premium. So of the $18,000 that I paid to Mega alone, I send in $1000 of claims and $850 of prescriptions and Im not eligible for a premium return? I also have the receipts for the other thousands of dollars in claim fees and lab fees and other services that they didnt pay for so this plan actually cost me closer to $30,000. It would have been a better deal for me to pay completely out of pocket for all of my medical expenses rather than give them $16,000 for services not rendered. THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY. THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT. And NASEs representation of them means that NASE is also a scam. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS before it costs you more than it did me.']"

Suddenly, they stopped knowing how to do paperwork. I heard various and sundry excuses for nine months following my surgery as to why they had not yet paid Mayo Clinic what they were supposed to pay them. First, they were really backed up. Then, my claim was incorrectly auto-adjudicated. The most recent one Ive heard is that they arent paying their own bills! They have (had?) a contract with Mayo, and since they havent been paying what theyre supposed to, Mayo is balanced billing me. Over the past nine months, I have spoken to twelve different Medica employees, a few of them on more than one occasion. Each of them has been very cordial but apparently very limited in their ability to help their clients, as I am STILL dealing with this problem nine months later. I cant help but wonder if they are hoping Ill be sent to collections by the clinic so that it wont be their problem anymore. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for several months; I should not have to give benefits to my insurance company. Last I heard, it was supposed to be the other way around.']"

NO! Im not stupid and know Arthritis and TMJ do not resolve. They are permanant conditions and lab tests etc. are NOT necessary for these conditions. They only want me to come in and pay the MUCH higher than before co-pays to run tests that are not necessary and are worthless as far as my conditions.

39520,Medica Insurance Company,"['When I was healthy, Medica was great. It covered the few prescriptions I had and my annual exams. Then, I had back surgery. Suddenly, they stopped knowing how to do paperwork. I heard various and sundry excuses for nine months following my surgery as to why they had not yet paid Mayo Clinic what they were supposed to pay them. First, they were really backed up. Then, my claim was incorrectly auto-adjudicated. The most recent one Ive heard is that they arent paying their own bills! They have (had?) a contract with Mayo, and since they havent been paying what theyre supposed to, Mayo is balanced billing me. Over the past nine months, I have spoken to twelve different Medica employees, a few of them on more than one occasion. Each of them has been very cordial but apparently very limited in their ability to help their clients, as I am STILL dealing with this problem nine months later. I cant help but wonder if they are hoping Ill be sent to collections by the clinic so that it wont be their problem anymore. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for several months; I should not have to give benefits to my insurance company. Last I heard, it was supposed to be the other way around.']"

93078,Medica Insurance Company,"['When I was healthy, Medica was great. It covered the few prescriptions I had and my annual exams. Then, I had back surgery. Suddenly, they stopped knowing how to do paperwork. I heard various and sundry excuses for nine months following my surgery as to why they had not yet paid Mayo Clinic what they were supposed to pay them. First, they were really backed up. Then, my claim was incorrectly auto-adjudicated. The most recent one Ive heard is that they arent paying their own bills! They have (had?) a contract with Mayo, and since they havent been paying what theyre supposed to, Mayo is balanced billing me. Over the past nine months, I have spoken to twelve different Medica employees, a few of them on more than one occasion. Each of them has been very cordial but apparently very limited in their ability to help their clients, as I am STILL dealing with this problem nine months later. I cant help but wonder if they are hoping Ill be sent to collections by the clinic so that it wont be their problem anymore. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for several months; I should not have to give benefits to my insurance company. Last I heard, it was supposed to be the other way around.']"
50328,CareSource,"['Signed up for MegaLife + NASE policy when I became self-employed. Rarely used the policy even for preventative services initially but still paid the separate $200-$300 monthly premium to ML and $40 monthly fee to NASE. When I cancelled my policy, was told that the ~$1000 for claims and ~$850 in prescription fees exceeded the amount that was accumulated in the so-called Return of Premium feature and so was not eligible for any refunds of premium. So of the $18,000 that I paid to Mega alone, I send in $1000 of claims and $850 of prescriptions and Im not eligible for a premium return? I also have the receipts for the other thousands of dollars in claim fees and lab fees and other services that they didnt pay for so this plan actually cost me closer to $30,000. It would have been a better deal for me to pay completely out of pocket for all of my medical expenses rather than give them $16,000 for services not rendered. THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY. THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT. And NASEs representation of them means that NASE is also a scam. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS before it costs you more than it did me.']"

physical therapy or taking cortisone shots. but she has gone through physical therapy and it was stopped because it only perpetuated the problem she is also allergic to prednisone which has some of

when called on it, claimed that the new reason was the lack of an &, i.e. the claim was submitted to bcbs, not bc&bs. well two of those initials are correct. for inauguration day, they announce that effective 1/1, they would no longer cover certain medications i was on. and go figure, those medications were working. had they told me during open enrollment - i would have investigated another option - now i cannot for 12 months. lets not even go into the fact that they notify me that they stopped covering items the day the coverage year started not in advance - but 3 weeks after the fact, and 7 weeks after my coverage decisions were final for the next year. instead, they require me to take an alternative, which caused an adverse reaction that nearly put me in the hospital. so, off that medicine - on to another one. tell my doctor the new medicine is covered - and 12 hours later at the pharmacy, it is denied. instead they suggested 1) i should go back on the prior medicine...the adverse reaction will eventually go away. 2) i should take another drug - which i am already on. i point this out, and they suggest i take more. i point out i am at the fda maximum dose, and they suggest, i should still take more - these maximums arent really limits. so, right now they are refusing to cover a different medicine until i go back on the other medicine. after all, it is my fault i

their part to charge me early. and that next month in jan i would only need to pay my 2016 payment price in order to off-set the dec increase mistake, that after jan i would resume my new increased payments. to begin with, blue shield gave 0 warnings on an increase. i received no emails/mail! now, just got off the phone with another representative, a male this time. i saw that my payments this

didn’t log in her location at the time. they cant trace the call without that or without a confirmation number which she never gave me. this played out too conveniently and is disgusting how they

pdp summary and every other summary i received and did not find anywhere that showed the $365 copay being paid. i believed that nedicare part b was covering the immumnosurpressants, which they do in fact cover, but only 80%. so, back in january of 2014, i go to retrive my meds (that cost me 0 for the past 2 years) and the pharmacy asks me for $365.i was stunned! what $365 ? where did this come from? i never saw anything that showed me that this even existed, and certainly nothing showing that this amount was paid by any insurer. i am told that this is the 20% copay that bc/bs was covering in 2012+13. well now if this ($365) is the 20% copay i would expect the total cost to be about $1825. it is not. to make things more confusing...somehow 2 prescriptions costing about $1200 have a 20% copay of $365. must be medical math? luckily for me a very nice transplant coordinator at rih helped me to get a temporary grant from pan (patient access network) to cover the copay, otherwise i would be on a ramen noodle diet. but the problem still exists for me and others like me because immunos are not handled like other meds by the insurance co.s it is difficult to find which plan covers what.

Rarely used the policy even for preventative services initially but still paid the separate $200-$300 monthly premium to ML and $40 monthly fee to NASE. When I cancelled my policy, was told that the ~$1000 for claims and ~$850 in prescription fees exceeded the amount that was accumulated in the so-called Return of Premium feature and so was not eligible for any refunds of premium. So of the $18,000 that I paid to Mega alone, I send in $1000 of claims and $850 of prescriptions and Im not eligible for a premium return? I also have the receipts for the other thousands of dollars in claim fees and lab fees and other services that they didnt pay for so this plan actually cost me closer to $30,000. It would have been a better deal for me to pay completely out of pocket for all of my medical expenses rather than give them $16,000 for services not rendered. THIS IS NOT A GOOD COMPANY. THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT. And NASEs representation of them means that NASE is also a scam. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS before it costs you more than it did me.']"

will have to fight to get them to pay for basic covered services by your plan. they will request information from you and they will claim that they have not received anything so they do not pay and will continue to do that until you give up and pay it yourself. since the beginning of 2016 until today, i spent more than $6000 from my own pocket for claims which unitedhealthcare refused to pay

although named the same, has a more restrictive provider list than other uhc choice plus networks. now you are locked in for a year with less coverage than you thought you were paying for. also, you

1 is not covered at all ($1296.00) for a 90-day supply and the 5th, (last) prescription is not eligible for mail-order? my out-of pocket prescription costs went from $120 a month at my local grocery

made record profits this year because this is how they treat their members: charge them outrageous premiums, refuse to pay when members need to use their insurance; drop hospitals, facilities, and doctors mid-year so members are forced to pay uhc and pay out-of-pocket to doctors. uhc is unethical; they force you to hold their insurance a year, yet they drop your doctors and hospitals soon after

44794,Aetna Life Insurance Company,"['Terrible, aetna was one of several choices provided by my employer in this location. i have used them for several years now and i am very disappointed by their claims coverage and customer service. they repeatedly denied claims for services that should be covered (example: pt after surgery - that one should be a no-brainer). i have spent an unbelievable amount of time on the phone and in writing trying unsuccessfully to appeal denials. every time i call about a denied claim, the rep gives me a different story. twice i have filed all the required paperwork, gone through the appeals, been informed that the claim would be covered - only to have the decision reversed again down the line. their strategy seems to be to wear down the customer. in summary, aetna is the best advertisement for a single-payer system that i can think of. if you have any alternative - dont use them.', 'Utterly inconvenient-lame good for nothing coverag, so far....i have paid more than $5000 to doctors out of pocket. this company takes painfully long period to review the case once the patients file is sent for it. i have been calling them since around june to send my case for the review. its end of september now and i found out today that the case had still not been sent because a document was required and pending....which was faxed to them twice almost two months ago and it was confirmed over the phone that it has been received. anyway the agent put me on hold and then came back with the information that document was available with them in the system but the case for review was just not forwarded. i was obviously annoyed and asked why....the agent couldnt kept her cool and said she can only tell me what the system says and theres nothing she can do and that she cant speak for what the previous agents had been telling me. so... two more months if the report actually gets sent....and if it does and if the review is completed in next two months id have waited 5 months just for the review. and if i still after a couple of months find out report was sent for review id have to wait another couple of months because that just is how long it takes for the review process and verifications to complete...and i fear they are going to cover hardly anything the way they have been going about it so far...once the process does get completed....', 'Doesnt cover much, aside from the copay already being pretty high ($50) a visit, the insurance didnt cover much. ive had to have different doctors resubmit regular preventative care tests several times just to still end up with a large bill.', 'Appalling, unforgivably bad claims process, ive been insured twice with aetna international while working abroad (first in south africa, then in japan). while the website has evolved somewhat over time, the claims process remains absolutely abysmal. virtually every claim i filed was mishandled in some way and required follow-up, sometimes five or more times for a single claim. sometimes all records of a claim mysteriously disappeared, and aetna said they had no idea what had happened. in these cases, i forwarded them my confirmations of the submissions and they asked me to re-submit everything from scratch since they didnt know what had gone wrong. in other cases, ive had claims which were processed, approved, and supposedly paid out, but cant find any payment corresponding to the date on which they claimed to have paid. when ive asked for confirmation of where the money was sent, they didnt know and said theyd have to investigate. in other cases, payments did come through, but without a clear reference to identify which claims they corresponded to, and aetnas own people couldnt identify which payments corresponded to which claims. this isnt a trivial problem when youre working with foreign currencies whose exchange rates fluctuate. if i submit a claim in yen or euros, its not clear what the corresponding value will be in usd when the reimbursement reaches my us account. and since they sometimes pay out multiple claims in a single lump, this makes it even harder to identify without a detailed reference. ive also encountered numerous cases where they messed up the claim date, leading to further confusion. aetna international is based in the us, but forms submitted abroad typically have the date format reversed (dd/mm). one would think an insurer that caters specifically to expats would have this figured out, but no. if i visit the doctor on april 8, odds are high that theyll input it as august 4 instead.', 'Ffff, sold policy after speaking to rep. told all meds were covered. they were but it was cheaper to buy without etna insurance. was also told my doctor was in

your own risk.', 'Antiquated and incompetent processes, #1 issue: ongoing since january 2016 is that aetna network management indicates to my provider his reimbursement is $80-84; yet aetna continues to process claims only paying provider $55. week after week, month after month, aetna has not resolved this issue. #2 issue: really takes a long time to dispute claims, have claims reviewed, re-processed; something that should only take a few days takes 2-3 months or more. #3 issue: customer service reps are so nice, making promises to assist, yet you get no where. customer service reps really can not do a thing for you. #4 issue: claims backlog for first three months of the year; eobs not mailed or uploaded on portal. eobs and claims are never processed real time, but run 30-45 days. eobs upload turn of the month and may be 1-2 months behind. corrected eobs do not ever show up on the portal, only the first claim entry, first eob, is posted, not any revised ones. #5 the right

consulted businesses for years, not only do i know of what i speak, but i am exponentially more critical than most when weighing a companys operation, including the heart of any business, customer service. this company is the gold standard. in recent years, i continually exhaust my patience when attempting to get information or seek a solution to a problem. every employee i have spoken to has been exemplary. kind, courteous, knowledgeable and efficient - sounds like a paid solicitation, its not. finding and correcting faults, is how i made a living. id go broke with aetna. they do it right. why, you ask, am i being so complimentary? because most businesses think accepting returns is good customer service. the efficiency of aetnas employees are seldom seen today and they deserve credit for their distinguished efforts.', 'Bad. before, much worse now, policy changes without notification, medicine costs by aetna home delivery obnoxiously expensive. i am a veteran and i thought they were good, tricare not available for my wife, they are plain and simple thieves. i hope to god they go bankrupt.', 'Ignorant customer service, due to the fact that hardly anyone at aetna knows what they are doing we have received two different bills that should have been covered by insurance. the first bill was for our babys wellness check at birth and the bill was kicked back to us three times. the billing company said that it was a normal occurrence with aetna insurance. she said they purposely kick bills back...its an automatic setting in their system. she said if we get the bill again then she would send us a form to fill out that they fax or mail to aetna so it doesnt go through their system and is handled by a person. second, due to a switch in insurance companies a bill was not going to be covered by aetna but because aetnas employees did not understand the problem it took them over 15 months to finally let the company know that the bill was not going to be covered by them. 15 months! that meant we could not file it with the other insurance because there is a one year file time. what company needs 15 months to figure out a simple billing problem?', 'Claims never paid, overall i have not been satisfied with aetna. several doctors visits in 2016 were not paid by aetna and they never provided any explanation of why they were not covered. in the end i had to pay over $1250 of claims out of pocket because aetna wouldnt cover the claims and after resubmitting the claim 4x and calling their claims department 6x i simply give up!', 'Horrible care, aetna has denied necessary treatment for my childs auto immune encephalitis . many have the same problem of neglect from duties from aetna . stay away from aetna they are fraudulent and neglectful . or just greedy..', 'Outrageous cost, it started good but my premiums have tripled. i can no longer afford the insulin pump because they dont cover it anymore, barely afford insulin and they cant seem to provide or cover drugs mandated by the aca. i fixing to drop insurance because at this point the cost is the same without it and i will be able to get the drugs i need. this company is a complete scam.', 'Aetna is superlatively unscrupulous,poss. criminal, i have had aetna for over 5 years through my work. like everyone i work with, i loved it...until i needed a doctor. my experience has led me to the thesis that they are unwilling to pay for claims if even the smallest technical problem is seen on the referral or a prescription is very expensive...in which case they require pre-authorization that is impossible to get approved in time in emergency situations (and backdating for reimbursements is a pasquinade to lure you into their premiums). for example, i recently needed a pre-authorization for a prescription that i paid for in an emergency. they take >48 hours to approve pre-auths, even in emergency situations. so, after about a week, i called member services. they told me that my pre-authorization had been approved! yay! however, they wanted me to call the specialty pharmacy to backdate the pre-auth. the rep sounded so genuinely surprised that i was approved that i called him out on it. though he was very nice, told me that he could not help me backdate the pre-auth, and that i should call the pre-auth number. when i did, i was told that there is no record i ever had a pre-auth and that i should call member services. so having come full circle, i called member services and reminded the representative that i had already called 3, and that i was told two days prior that my pre-auth was pending; one day prior i was told (surprisingly) that i was approved; and today i was told no such authorization was ever submitted by the doctor on my behalf. the subterfuge escalated, and i was told there was nobody available to help him find the missing record. he said he would call me back and he never did. i paid $1500 for my medication for the second time without being reimbursed. i wish this event was isolated, but over the past two years ive paid for 2 specialist visits and at least 3 medications out of pocket. the bottom line is: go with aetna only if you never plan on using your expensive health insurance policy!', 'Horrible save yourself, i have had a insurance plan on my son for 10 yrs. he was with another company that was bought out by aetna 2 years ago. on november 16 i called aetna because i heard they were pulling out of the area. when i called, they have confirmed they have the call, they said that his policy was not affected as it was not through the market place. when i called in january to pay his premium payment and was told his policy was cancelled. for the same reason they told me it wasnt affected. i tried to get a new policy quoted and got the run around being transferred all over then told someone would call me. meanwhile my son who takes medication monthly was without insurance and i was told we are sorry that you were given incorrect information and we do have that recorded but there is nothing we can do. so we suffer. luckily i was able to put him on my insurance at work although it is costing me double and affecting our finances since we had not planned on this type of burden. today 01.16.2017 i finally received a call from someone to quote the prices for a new policy, this is 2 weeks later. no thank you! save yourself and dont believe anything they tell you. when they mess up you will pay for it and they will do nothing to assist. they have no problem taking your money though.', 'Good news, aetna will no longer be listed as a choice on the healthcare marketplace. go to wikipedia and look up aetna. there ts a long list of abuses and complaints against them and fines they have paid throughout the years. enough said!', 'You cannot rely on them., aetna once provided me with a very inexpensive aca-grandfathered high-deductible plan. then one day aetna decided it was simply not going to renew my policy, thus leaving me stranded with no health insurance. i was lucky to get into altruas health sharing ministry because i would otherwise now be uninsured. (see also liberty healthshare, medishare, and samaritan ministries for alternatives if you are in a similar situation.) i would never do business with aetna again because it is clear that i cannot rely on them.', 'Don’t get aetna for any coverage of any kind., it is my opinion: years ago, i purchased a long-term and a short term disability policy from aetna through my employer. 2 years ago when i became disabled because of a heart attack and numerous other health issues, verified by 3 doctors. aetna harassed my wife and i, threatened me with job termination, discontinued my pay and benefits, conveniently lost or never received documents my doctors and i sent to them, misreported documented facts, committed fraud, made numerous mistakes in aetna’s favor, told me verbal lies in phone conversations, made outrageous demands under the threat of job termination “if you don’t go to the doctor today and submit these forms you will be terminated from your job”, etc, etc., etc. aetna ceo mark bertolinis compensation was valued at $17.3 million last year. he got it by screwing people like you and me. don’t get aetna for any coverage of any kind.', 'Worst health ins ever, aetna wont approve mri, aetna wants doc to put me on narcotics for a ruptured disc first and physical therapy. i will not be accepting this coverage from my employer when they renew next year. i just hope and pray everyone who works for aetna ends up in the same pain i have. if i were a refugee i would not have to live in this pain.', 'Worst insurance ever, i had to deal with the claim department for short term disability after i had brain surgery and i had the worst experience of my life going from person to person and no one was ever able to satisfied my request for communication with my doctor. i had to do most of their job from my bed while trying to recuperate from a very serious health condition. i would never recommend this insurance to anyone.', 'The only reason why i need insurance is because im getting divorced and cannot be in his plan anymore.', 'Excellent customer service, i had an unexpected health problem and had a heart transplant. aetnas coverage has been fantastic and the customer service has been fantastic. two hospitals have created billing errors on multiple occasions. the hospitals have had problems sorting out their own errors. i call aetna and aetna takes charge of the situation and helps the hospital straighten out their own billing errors. on one occasion, the hospital could not figure out the error they made, and aetna actually figured it out and told the hospital how to correct it in their system. aetna goes above and beyond to help out their patients.', 'An expensive card, i have the aetna health insurance card in my wallet and i thought that it was supposed to help me out with the health care costs sense i pay them and astronomical amount of money every week. well, it really doesnt, my wife and i had a baby this year and if i had not had insurance at all, i would have come out ahead without premiums and deductibles, and coinsurance. they claim to cover postpartum care under the mothers deductible and coinsurance, but really thats a lie, they only cover a few days but not the whole thing. my son was born 5 weeks early and needed to be in nicu for 2 weeks, they coverd the 1st 5 days of his stay under his mothers deductible then split him off onto his own so i have to pay yet another deducible. why do i pay them again? they are not helpful and they cost me a ton of money every year for very little coverage.', 'Okay, want another company quote', 'No longer on insurance, mom is working minimally due to illness,, cobra is 1300 per month. she needs this insurance to keep her doctors but if i have a separate inexpensive plan her cobra payments will be a lot less. i am a student and have no income', 'Very good insurance, never had a problem with them, if you follow the rules, get the referrals. had this insurance for years.', 'Change job location so no coverage, insurance for being oversea. i am now back working in the us.', 'Company based insurer, no longer employed., i liked the coverage. however, my husband no longer works for the company so i have to get other insurance.', 'Good insurance, good insurance but without employer contribution, i am unable to shoulder the whole premium since i was laid off yesterday.', 'Great service', 'Retired no longer eligible for this plan, aetna provided by union contract, having retired the coverage terminates', 'Good, good', 'Just looking for other insurance, i just want to check out other compaines to see who has maybe better rates for when im gone there will be some insurance to pay off my bills so family members wont have to.', 'Very good, very well helped me majorly', 'They cancelled my plan, i would have stayed with aetna but they discontinued my policy', 'Great but increased prices, the new coverage more than doubled overnight.', 'Need affordable coverate, my present coverage is doubling and i cant afford that. i need a more affordable monthly premium with not too high copays.', 'Unsure of new coverage, i am shopping around because i dont like my companys new insurance plans with aetna. no co-pays, but coinsurance is out rageous.', 'Losing itp because of obama care', 'Health care, overall company does a good job. deductible is somewhat high but really not sure of competion.employees are friendly and helpful but need to clarifycertain details.', 'I am separated and my devoice will soon be final', 'Aetna has chosen to no longer sell this product in my area.', 'Aetna, am on cobra and it ends march 1, 2014', 'Need more coverage, i have had no problems with this company just need more coverage now so i am checking rates. i have type2 diabetes and need more dr. visits.', 'Aetna cobra ending, i had taken cobra coverage on move to massachusetts to have coverage until getting settled in new area and new job.', 'Insurance through work getting very expensive', 'Very good,', 'It is free health insurance,', 'Quotes,', 'My own policy,', 'Retired and aetna ends 8-31-16,', 'Part of family plan of father,', 'Losing coverage soon, changing jobs,', '$2000 death benefit only,', 'Doctors covered,', 'Very good,', 'Good company,', 'Loosing insurance,', 'Weighing my options,']"
