The President of the United States
has already made a major decision concerning the use of federal funds for
embryonic stem cell research, and has convened a special presidential commission
to address the difficult problems of biomedical ethics.
Whatever the outcome of either scientific investigation or the publicly
determined legality of these investigations, the fact remains that today the
freedom of conscience of Americans enrolled in public and private health
insurance programs is not currently protected.
Ask
yourselves these questions anytime you ponder healthcare policy or healthcare
reform, especially in the context of medical or biomedical ethics.
The good news is that there is a growing, bipartisan consensus among
professional economists and health care policy analysts, that we ought to change
the tax treatment of health insurance for the purpose not only of creating a
more efficient market, but also to expand health care coverage and empower
individuals and families to make the key decisions which affect their health
care.

particularly the perception that patients were arriving with poor prior dental
work.
Clearly, health insurance companies need to have
bioethicists on call, perhaps specializing in areas such as transplants, gene

As
a member of the Council, I frequently reflected on the implications for minority
groups of the nation's portfolio of scientific, social scientific, and
humanistic research relating to genetics.
The history of human achievement has been marred by the dissemination of a
good deal of scholarly and scientific nonsense about inherited [*890]  traits.
This Symposium
contains a great deal of information about the misuses of science and scientific
information relating to genetics, about the potential for clinical abuses, and
about government complicity.
But
as the Symposium demonstrates, at least four key issues surround the evaluation
of genetic testing: (1) whether genetic testing practices are based on accurate
information and research, rather [*892]  than on myth, stereotype and prejudiced
interpretations; (2) whether society provides equity in access to genetic
testing with clear health benefits; (3) whether the delivery of genetic testing
and other services is voluntary and appropriately respects the dignity, privacy,
and confidentiality of individuals and families; and (4) whether there can be
equal respect for the choices people of color make on the basis of genetic
information, especially if those choices are different from the choices whites
make.
Or would be be better
served to stop, think, and engage all our health professional in coming up with
a plan for a proper health system, free for all who need it at the point of
delivery?
Unlike most

Examples of   the constraints include asking doctors to maintain the repeat

The rights of patients and professionals, an examination of the ways patients'

One of the main purposes of the course, said Hellegers, was to teach the

When faced with a major problem in their home institution, such as whether it is

the course will "know that when there's a discussion to be led they'd better get
a professional ethicist."

'Work with us';
Health-care solutions sought by professionals

BYLINE: Dr. James D. Felsen

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg.
The Unicorn UK Smaller Companies fund has 15pc of its cash in industrial
engineering businesses, 11.5pc in support services, and 11pc in construction
companies.
It is time for us to join the rest of the industrialized world and treat health
care as a social need instead of as a commodity.
The German
Embassy co-sponsored the program and their counselors for the social and labor
policy section, G<um u>nther Horzetzky, and for the scientific section, Karl
Wolin, made the setting up of a truly comparative approach between the American
and the German health care systems possible.
In 1884, followed the law about workmen's
compensation (statutory occupational accident insurance) and, in 1889, the law
on invalidity insurance and on retirement insurance.
Urban
industrial workers, however, have no such social security network.
Germany
certainly needs  [*588]  reforms to sustain the system and preserve the quality
of care it offers, but it must also preserve the substance of its social health
insurance system for the family in order to stabilize it in a rapidly changing
industrial world.
With relation to
the health care industry, the promise of the market is to increase competition
and to rationalize the system without necessarily altering the fundamentally
moral nature of the clinical exchange or undermining the professional standards
entailed.
It is no wonder that both scholars and practitioners have sought out
insights of other industrialized nations to ascertain the problems and promises
of their "national" approach to health care.
The high prices of devices, drugs and hospital and professional services
are also significant factors in overall costs.
·     We need to be sure that we recommend only interventions or services
          that in the physician's best professional judgment will substantially
          benefit the patient without placing undue burdens on health care
          resources.

          that in the physician's best professional judgment will substantially
          benefit the patient without placing undue burdens on health care
          resources.
As two leaders of the White House health task force -- Princeton
sociologist Paul Starr and California Insurance Commission deputy Walter A.
Zelman -- pointed out in a special issue of the policy journal "Health Affairs:"
"The moral imperative is to achieve equal access to care and protection against
financial destitution for the millions now uninsured or underinsured.
They maintain the highest
professional standards, and struggle to overcome time pressure despite the
burgeoning bureaucratic burden they face.
"When it comes to sustainable production, however, consumers could justifiably
ask: why shout about it with a special label - shouldn't [the Fairtrade ethos]
be part of everyday business practice?"
ETHICAL ISSUES AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE ALLOCATION OF HEALTH
CARE - WHY PROBLEMS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE DIFFER FROM THOSE OF INDIVIDUAL ETHICAL
BEHAVIOR AND CALL FOR VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES

 Addressing ethical problems concerning the allocation of health care or other
social goods and services requires understanding their special nature and
finding strategies for solutions in ways that are quite different from
individual ethical behavior in particular situations.
Public opinion polls, professional consensus and
other indicators showed that there was firm political support for major reform
of the health insurance system.
Most medical services are provided on a private basis, while
publicly operated services constitute a small sector of care for indigent or
other special population groups.
Physicians are not organized in
associations that could represent their collective professional and financial
interests in exchange for responsible self-control of costs or mode of providing
services.
It was implemented as a means of
preempting the appeal of socialism and furthering a mercantilist-like approach
to rapid industrialization by encouraging solidarity between employers, workers
and government.
From 1900 onward, professional associations were organized for the purpose of
gaining professional recognition, setting standards and acting as collective
bargaining and pressure groups to attain the political and economic goals of
their members.
In the same way, legislative efforts to
control costs in the private sector failed to overcome similar political
resistance from well organized and financed professional groups and the
insurance industry.
For example, how can
the need for campaign-finance reform to moderate the influence of powerful
special-interest groups be reconciled with the Constitutional rights of free
speech and unrestricted use of private property?
Of course, special-interest lobbying also plays an important positive role
in bringing particular issues to the attention of Congress and advocating
legislation for the overall public interest.
O.K., I've rephrased it totally and unflatteringly, but
the answer -- no -- is provided by the American Psychiatric Association's
''Principles of Medical Ethics,'' which requires you to be ''honest in all
professional interactions.''
So when Ukip talks about immigration control - especially the Australian-style
points system we've proposed - the national media goes into a frenzy.

Six insurance professionals have created a new organization they say will seek
to uphold professional standards and responsibilities for insurance agents by
awarding a new designation.
The organizers said they would establish and enforce professional standards,
implement an accreditation process and promote the designation to both the
industry and the public in a national publicity campaign.
There will also be a board of professional standards that will approve the
certification of each benefit advisor, review consumer complaints and issue
recommendations.
As with many business decisions, the use of
professionals can help save a large amount of time and money, and our advice

More than 1,000 clinics in the private sector, both GPs and specialists, will be
affected by this ruling, as they have patients who are sent to them from TPAs,
especially those who represent insurers, and companies that offer medical
benefits to employees.
The other is that more than 80 per cent of bills from the practice should "fall
within a narrow range", which would apply to most GP clinics but not likely to
specialists, whose services and fees could vary greatly.
Ms Veronica Allen, chief executive officer of Parkway Shenton which has about
680 specialists and 360 GP clinics under its third-party agreements, said: "We
agree that administrative fees charged should primarily reflect the work of the
TPA and not be so high as to constitute fee splitting with the doctor."
The SMC said last night that it "appreciates the support of our professional
bodies", and repeated that fees paid must reflect actual work done by the TPA
and be transparent to the patient or payer.

The great professional rip-off continues.
In a carefully worked out publicity campaign, the Ontario Government
 has created a situation which must ultimately destroy the professional
 aspects of medicine in Ontario.
The campaign works because it is
 received and orchestrated by the media, which have not carefully examined
 their own professional responsibility and possible conflicts of interest.
Both doctors and reporters must recognize
 that they have professional obligations that raise ethical and moral
 questions and make their work more than just getting the story and
 collecting a pay cheque or prescribing the drug and billing OHIP.
The general public, which is not made up of professionals, wants
 individualized, personal, professional, ethical and responsible service
 and hopes to pay for it on some kind of negotiated hourly rate.
If a professional's income is not directly linked to his performance,
 he may as well be working on an assembly line, turning one bolt after
 another.
But Americans
consistently grade Congress at a D or worse on such fundamental measures as
whether it is dealing with key issues facing the country, keeping excessive
partisanship in check, holding its members to high ethical standards, and
controlling the influence of special interests.
So congressional reform initiatives that take aim at legitimate issues ought to
have a place at the table; especially in tough times, it's important for
Congress not to appear to be getting special breaks at the taxpayer's expense.
More likely, the proposal was
simply too sweeping for Washington's special case: It would have cost the state
the speakership held by Rep. Tom Foley, and giving up that much hard-won clout
in Congress is too much to ask of even the most selfless electorate.

INTRODUCTION

    Perhaps more than any other professional activity, medical care is imbued
with ethical principles.
Meanwhile, the
dual problems of health care costs and restricted access threaten to spin the
existing health care system out of control.
Insurers and benefits managers at large
companies now tend to leave large geographic risk pools and base insurance rates
on their employees alone, especially when it seems that the employees  [*40]
are healthier than the rest of the population.
n25

    As commercial insurance became more widespread, and especially as Medicare
n26 and Medicaid  n27 were introduced, hospitals could reasonably expect to be
reimbursed for services.
n95 Since Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, in which the United
States Supreme Court held that antitrust laws are applicable to professionals,
n96 physicians and hospitals have been the targets of increasing scru [*53]
tiny.
Any
ethical principle will be carefully scrutinized for economic advantages it may
create for providers, especially physicians.
n105

    The arguments from those suspicious of appeals to professional ethics have a
great deal of merit.
n110 A corollary to this theory is that
using professional ethics to reform medical care is unnecessary and perhaps
counterproductive.
Although the pure procedural justice
of the market is admirable, the consequences of an unregulated market,
especially the unequal access to health care for those unable to pay, undermine
ethical health care.
Thus, plans that
offer a single set of benefits are especially in need of elaborate cost-control
programs.
A restricted set of benefits
with the same ceiling for all would be very true to the class of patients,
treating each patient equally.
Indeed, a floor with a consumer choice of ceilings appears consistent with
the ethics of health policy only if the inequalities between floor and ceiling
are restricted by some set of wealth transfers, such as a tax on the purchase of
services above the floor that explicitly subsidizes a higher floor.
Information sharing is an ethical imperative that is not restricted to
competitive approaches.
No matter how it is
accomplished, disclosure will be a serious ethical mandate, one that managed
competitors will be especially hard pressed to meet.
Nor do I mean to suggest that society should
"depend on professionals complying with principles of justice."
Neighborhood health centers
were meant to provide primary care services for the family, with less emphasis
on specialized and technologically oriented care.
Nowhere in this portion
of his argument does Daniels consider professionals or professional ethics.
In
fact, he raises these issues later, but only to show the peripheral nature of
professional ethics to just health care, and to suggest that it would be
inappropriate to rely on provider-based principles to determine an ethical
distribution of health care resources.
While Daniels does not consider the relation between
professional ethics and justice to be critical, Emanuel (at least in his initial
chapters) does.
He notes that professional ethics cannot be distinguished from
political theory, but there must be a synergistic relationship between these two
areas of thought.
Nor
is it clear that radical inequality would not develop around community health
programs, especially if budget constraints begin to ration down the value of the
public voucher.
Under the
model of minimally restrictive patient advocacy, "considerations of justice do
furnish a moral basis for individual action, because principles of professional
ethics derive from roles specified by just institutions."
Under
maximally restricted patient advocacy, "both considerations of social justice
and other considerations involving social welfare afford a moral basis for
individual action, because principles of professional ethics derive from
normative principles generally."
Others have been concerned
about the need for moral integrity in health care institutions, especially those
involved in the training of physicians.
Breaking down the barriers
between interpersonal and institutional ethics does create a risk that the
