Health insurance: A defined benefit plan or indemnity based plan; which one you
should opt for

BYLINE: Adhil Shetty

LENGTH: 621  words


Health insurance needs vary from person to person and largely depend on the age
and lifestyle of the individual.


People often ignore post-hospitalisation
expenses, which can be higher than hospitalisation, while buying a health
insurance plan.


Here is everything you need to
know about indemnity based health insurance vis-a-vis defined health insurance
plans and which one should you opt for.


Indemnity-based and defined benefit plans

The common perception is that health insurance is a financial instrument that
offers a cover for expenses incurred when one is hospitalised.


But since
sometimes post-hospitalisation expenses can be far higher than the
hospitalisation charges itself, health insurers have devised plans to cover for
such expenses.


Health insurance plans are therefore broadly classified as two
distinct types namely indemnity-based and defined benefit-based to cover for
both the scenarios.


Indemnity-based health insurance plans are those which offer coverage and
eventual repayment of expenses incurred during hospitalisation as per the
selected health insurance plan.


Defined benefit plans offer a pre defined lump
sum payout for a particular disease, irrespective of any pre- or post
hospitalisation expenses.


Common examples of indemnity based health insurance
plans are Mediclaim policies or family floater plans while critical illness
plans or disease specific plans are examples of defined benefit health insurance
plans.


Comparing the two plans

Indemnity insurance plans offer repayment as per the submitted hospitalisation
bills.


For example, if you have an indemnity health insurance plan with a sum
insured of Rs 5 lakh and hospitalisation bills amount to Rs 2 lakh, you will get
a reimbursement of Rs 2 lakh post submission of bills.


A defined benefit plan
does not require submission of any bills and you are paid a pre-defined lump sum
amount as per the plan.


A diagnosis report signed by a medical specialist must
be submitted for availing lump sum payout for such a plan.


On the downside, indemnity plans have a deductible clause which means that
policyholder has to cover for some percentage of the hospitalisation expenses.


Cost of post-operative care and medication is excluded in indemnity health
plans.


Defined health benefit plans usually offer a cap on hospital cash cover.


So, if a policyholder opts for a defined health benefit plan, the payout per day
will be as per the stipulated limit irrespective of the amount spent by the
policyholder during hospital stay.


Choosing between the two

Both the plans have their advantages and choosing between the two must be
correlated as per the individual health needs of a policy seeker.


For example,
if someone has a high risk of specific ailments that run in the family, a
defined benefit plan may be the right choice along with an indemnity insurance
plan to make for a comprehensive health cover.


Also, since chances of claim rejection in the event of a pre-defined cover are
lower than indemnity based health insurance plans, doubling both policies gives
a widespread cover towards any health eventuality.


Balancing between both
indemnity and defined benefit plans also ensures that any expenses towards pre
or post-hospitalisation are also covered and health insurance does not remain
limited to hospitalisation expenses alone.


Choosing between an indemnity and a
defined health benefit plan must be done as per the medical needs of the
policyholder.

India Network Health Insurance Announces Visitor Health Insurance Exchange

LENGTH: 490  words


Nov. 21 -- India Network health insurance issued the following news release:

India Network health insurance has offered various health insurance plans for
visitors coming to the United States, Canada and Mexico for more than two
decades.


Visitor Accident and Sickness health insurance plans offered include
both fixed benefit plans and comprehensive health insurance plans compatible
with those offered on the national health insurance exchange at Obamacare on
healthcare.gov but cost half of the price.


The ACE Comprehensive PPO network
plan offers coverage from age 0-99 year-olds with the option of coverage for
pre-existing problems.


In addition to traditional health insurance coverage, the
PPO plan also provides medical evacuation benefits, repatriation benefits, and
accidental death benefits of $25,000 for all policy holders.


Fixed benefit plans
offer limited benefits for lower premiums and most suitable for healthy
visitors.


Many international visitor health insurance plans are underwritten by foreign
insurance companies and India Network Plan is wholly administered in the United
States and underwritten by a US-based Insurance company, ACE American Insurance
company.


All claims are directly submitted by providers to the insurance claims
processor, eliminating the need for visitors to pay big bills if they get sick
and they are processed in the United States.


India Network visitor health insurance with pre-existing condition coverage is
available to all visitors of all ages if they purchase the plan before their
arrival in the United States.


Online enrollment forms on the India Network website provide an easy
way to complete enrollment into one of the plans offered by the plan and pay the
premiums using the credit card, including international credit cards with US
dollar denominations.


The Instant Quote link displays all available plans and
premiums along with coverage details in an easy format for visitors to
understand and choose the right plan for their needs.


Dr. KV Rao, President, India Network Foundation said that all visitors and
sponsors of visitors should be aware that purchasing a health plan before
visitors arrive in the United States will help quickly resolve any claims that
may happen right after arrival.


It costs much less to purchase health insurance
plans for sponsored visitors rather than dealing with collection departments of
various medical practices and hospitals.


India Network visitor health insurance plans are available only on the India
Network website and not offered through any agents or agencies in India or in
the United States.


All visitors are advised to read policy language carefully as
there are many plans that look like India Network health insurance program in
the market place but are not same.

eHealth Ready to Help Consumers Find Quality, Affordable Health Insurance During
Affordable Care Act's Nationwide Open Enrollment Period

LENGTH: 1429  words


Nov. 14 -- US-based eHealth, Inc. issued the following news release:

eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) (eHealthInsurance.com), the nation's first and
largest private online health insurance exchange, is marking the beginning of
the nationwide open enrollment period for 2015 individual and family health
insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by highlighting the consumer
resources and selection of plans available through eHealth.


"eHealth will be open and ready for business for the 2015 open enrollment
period," said Bill Shaughnessy, President and Chief Operating Officer of
eHealth, Inc. "Whether you're currently uninsured, happy or unhappy with your
current plan, currently receiving government subsidies or ineligible for
subsidies, this is your chance to review your coverage options for 2015, apply
for subsidy assistance, and enroll in the individual or family health insurance
plan that's right for your needs and budget."


"On a national scale, eHealth expects to offer more
2015 individual and family health insurance plans than any other marketplace in
the country.


eHealth delivers consumers personal help and support from real
licensed professionals as well as intuitive plan comparison tools and the
ability to look up plans accepted by specific doctors.


Coverage under new 2015
health insurance plans selected during open enrollment may begin as early as
January 1, 2015, depending on the date when consumers submit their applications
and on the policies of individual insurance companies.


Consumers without health
insurance at the end of the open enrollment period may have to wait until 2016
before getting health coverage that meets the requirements of the Affordable
Care Act.


During the open enrollment period, eHealth plans to enroll
subsidy-eligible consumers in the majority of states, including California and
the 37 states served by the federally-facilitated marketplace, utilizing broker
portals made available by these exchanges.


The company will also continue to
enroll unsubsidized individuals and families in ACA-compliant plans available
outside of government exchanges.


eHealth will offer a broad selection of 2015 health insurance plans

For the ACA's 2015 open enrollment period, eHealth expects to offer the largest
inventory of any marketplace for individual and family health insurance plans,
including both on-exchange and off-exchange plans.


For unsubsidized consumers,
eHealth expects to have more than 3,700 non-subsidy plans from more than 100
insurance companies across the country.


For subsidy-eligible consumers, eHealth
expects to offer more than 3,400 health insurance plans from more than 90
insurance companies, including access to on-exchange plans available through
government-run marketplaces in 38 states.


All of these major medical plans meet
ACA requirements and protect consumers from 2015 tax penalties as long as they
maintain their enrollment through 2015 without a gap or three months or longer.


eHealth is easier to use than ever before

eHealth's consumer-focused plan comparison and enrollment website provides
consumers with the easiest way to find the individual and family health
insurance plans best suited to their needs and budget and to enroll in coverage
online.


* The ability to look up which plans are accepted by specific doctors -- Many
consumers with preferred doctors and hospitals are wary of switching to plans
that may require them to change providers.


Based on network information provided
from the insurance companies, eHealth allows consumers to search for plans
accepted by specific primary care physicians or specialists.


* Simple, accurate, no-commitment quotes from brand-name insurance plans --
eHealth does not require consumers to create an account before they can review
personalized health insurance quotes from a broad selection of health insurance
plans in their area.


Since health insurance rates are regulated, consumers will
never find plans sold through eHealth available for lower monthly premiums
anywhere else.


* Comparison tools that make it easy to narrow down your choices -- The best way
for consumers to save money on health insurance is to shop from a broad
selection of plans and find the best match for their needs.


eHealth allows
shoppers to make detailed comparisons of up to five plans at a time.


It also
allows them to sort their plan choices based on doctors-in-network, monthly
premium, annual deductible, coinsurance, plan type, metal level, and whether
office visits are covered before or after the deductible.


eHealth offers customer support and resources that make a difference

Health insurance is a complex product and many consumers find the process of
selecting a health insurance plan for themselves or their family stressful and
overwhelming.


* Dozens of easy-to-understand educational videos -- Through eHealth's YouTube
channel, consumers can find new video playlists offering tips for health
insurance shoppers, help and insight for subsidy-eligible shoppers, advice on
what to do when your old plan is being cancelled, and more.


* The eHealth Price Index -- eHealth's Health Insurance Price Index tracks what
eHealth shoppers are paying for individual and family health insurance plans on
a day-to-day basis.


Health Insurance Outlet's top 6 ways to save on individual health insurance:

1) Comparison shop across all the health insurance plans

Based on your affordability, see what plans make sense for your health history.


If you are a healthier person, maybe a higher deductible plan will be the right
route for you.


2) Choose an individual health insurance plan with a smaller network

This will instantly save you money because health insurance carriers will always
charge you a premium if the network is large.


3) Increase your deductible on your California health insurance plan

The deductible is the money you have to pay out of your own pocket first before
the insurance carrier will start paying benefits.


4) Consider your health history and how old you are

For instance, if you do not have a history of taking prescription drugs, then
pick a plan with lower drug benefits and that will lower your California health
insurance premium.


These health insurance plans are meant for people who have recurring or
predictable health care needs.


HealthInsuranceOutlet.com Makes It Easy To Compare And Save On Health Insurance:

* Shop for Individual, Family, Child-Only, Short Term, Dental and Small Business
Health Insurance Plans

We provide
health insurance plans from all the major carriers in California.


The
Company also offers various online and pharmacy-based tools to help seniors
navigate Medicare health insurance options, choose the right plan, and enroll in
plans online or telephonically.


The Company's Medicare e-commerce platforms and telephonic enrollment
capabilities enable consumers to research, compare and purchase Medicare-related
health insurance plans, including Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement and
Medicare Part D prescription drug plans.


The Company markets the availability of
individual and family, small business and ancillary health insurance plans of
various insurance carriers through its e-commerce platforms (www.eHealth.com and
www.eHealthInsurance.com).


Its technology platform enables
health insurance carriers and agents to market and distribute health insurance
plans online.


The Company offers various plans, such as Medicare-related health
insurance; various medical individual and family health insurance coverage, such
as preferred provider organization, health maintenance organization and
indemnity plans; health savings account-eligible insurance plans, and ancillary
health insurance plans, which primarily consist of short-term, dental, life,
vision and accident insurance plans.


The Company's e-commerce platforms have various features, such as online rate
quoting and plan information; plan comparison and recommendations; online
application and enrollment forms; electronic processing interchange, and back
office systems.


The Company's e-commerce platforms provide consumers online rate
quotes and plan benefit information from a range of health insurance carriers.


Its e-commerce platform enables consumers to compare and
contrast health insurance plans in a side-by-side format based on plan
characteristics, such as price, plan type, deductible amount, co-payment amount,
and in-network and out-of-network benefits.


The Medicare plan comparison tool enables Medicare-eligible individuals to
compare plan premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket drug expenses, coverage
limitations on medications and other aspects of Medicare plans.


The Company's
automated recommendation capability for individual and family health insurance
presents a series of questions and recommends health insurance plans based on
the consumer's input.


The survey uncovered the health insurance literacy levels
of consumers who are shopping for health insurance during the 2017 open
enrollment season, including their overall confidence level and understanding of
insurance terminology and plans.


The survey found a 25% gap between consumers'
perceived and actual knowledge of these key health insurance terms:
"deductible", "co-pay", "coinsurance" and "out-of-pocket maximum."


The least understood health insurance term was
"coinsurance" with only 22% of consumers able to correctly define it, compared
to 42% who correctly defined "out-of-pocket maximum," 50% who understood the
meaning of "deductible" and 52% for "co-pay."


The PolicyGenius health insurance literacy survey also showed that 72% of those
with non-employer-provided health insurance policies plan to shop on the open
marketplace for coverage this year.


"For consumers, finding a good health insurance plan starts with
understanding the various trade-offs involved with different types of plans and
benefits.


Americans will need to weigh competing priorities, understand the
apples-to-apples difference between plans, and understand how decisions may
impact their total out-of-pocket costs.


It simplifies the shopping process by cutting
through the insurance jargon and helping consumers prioritize must-haves and
nice-to-haves to find the best plan for their needs."


The PolicyGenius health insurance app will offer consumers access to both
on-exchange and off-exchange health insurance plans, supported with plain
English explanations of benefits, transparent shopping options and smart
decisioning tools.


The PolicyGenius health insurance literacy survey also indicated:

* Most insured Americans are satisfied with their current plan, at 70% of total
respondents.


- People who used their health insurance 2-3 times in the past year are 12% more
likely to be satisfied with their plan than those who used it just once.


- Millennials are most likely to be satisfied with their health insurance plan,
at 77%.


- There is no variation in plan satisfaction between those who have individual
insurance versus employer-provided insurance.


* More than half of respondents aren't very confident in their ability to choose
the best health insurance plan for their needs.


- Only one-third of women overall are "very confident" in their ability to
choose the best health insurance plan for their needs.


- The two groups that showed the highest confidence in their ability to choose
the best plan were men at 58% and millennials at 43%.


- The survey found higher confidence levels in men over women (12% difference)
and younger vs older respondents (millennials were most confident at 43%, 10%
more than ages 45-55) in their ability to choose the best plan.


As such, student health insurance plans will be subject to several of the most
significant provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.


According to the preamble of the proposed regulations, the Government
Accountability Office has estimated that most students enrolled in U.S. colleges
and universities have health coverage through employer-sponsored group health
plans.


The proposed regulations do not apply to self-funded student health
plans.


Such coverage is required to satisfy any additional
requirements that may be imposed under state law.


For instance, student health insurance plans, like employer-sponsored
group health plans, are not permitted to rescind a participant's coverage except
in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact.


In addition, student health insurance plans are required to cover preventative
services without participant cost-sharing requirements, and are required to
extend health coverage to dependents up to age 26.


Student health insurance
plans are also prohibited from imposing pre-existing condition exclusions on
enrollees who are under age 19, and are subject to the new claims and appeals
procedures under health care reform.


Student health insurance plans are subject to a special transition period under
the proposed regulations with regard to health care reform's annual limit rules.


Specifically, under the proposed regulations, for policy years beginning on or
after Jan. 1, 2012, but before Sept. 23, 2012, a student health insurance plan
may not impose an annual dollar limit on "essential health benefits" (e.g.,
emergency services, maternity and newborn care, and pediatric services) that is
lower than $100,000.


(This is significantly lower than the $1.25 million
threshold applicable to employer-sponsored group health plans.)


For policy years
beginning on or after Sept. 23, 2012, but before Jan. 1, 2014, a student health
insurance plan may not impose an annual dollar limit on essential health
benefits that is lower than $2 million.


According to the proposed regulations, student health insurance coverage is
exempt from the guaranteed availability and guaranteed renewability requirements
under health care reform.


That is, student health insurance plans are not
required to offer coverage to certain eligible individuals, nor are such plans
required to permit individuals to renew or continue their coverage from year to
year.


The proposed regulations require health insurance issuers providing student
health insurance coverage to include a statement in written plan materials
notifying students that the policy may not meet all of the requirements under
health care reform.


As a reminder, effective for plan years beginning on or after Sept. 23, 2010,
group health plans and insurers are required to extend dependent health coverage
to adult children up to age 26.


Therefore, many college and university students
will likely remain covered under their parents' health plans, rather than
purchase their own student health insurance coverage.


Prior to the amendment many foreigners working for companies in Korea contracted
for private insurance plans that covered more than the government insurance
plans, thus, many would forgo use of the government insurance plan, but still
would be required to pay into the National Health Insurance plan.


To avail of this exemption from payments your employer may simply file with the
National Health Insurance Corporation a statement signed by the employee that he
or she wishes to withdraw from the health insurance plan and include with the
documents information related to your health insurance plan.


If I buy or re-enroll in a health plan during the Health Insurance Marketplace
open enrollment period, when will my coverage start?


If you are enrolled in a
marketplace health insurance plan, your coverage ends December 31, 2015.


To
continue health coverage in 2016, you can renew or choose a new plan during the
marketplace open enrollment period.


If you want your health insurance coverage to start January 1, 2016, you'll
need to sign up or renew your health plan by December 15, 2015.


Your coverage will begin...



 November 1, 2015 - December 15, 2015         January 1, 2016

 December 16, 2015 - January 15, 2016         February 1, 2016

 January 16, 2016 - January 31, 2016         March 1, 2016



 After I sign up for a health plan in the Health Insurance Marketplace, can I
change my mind and sign up for a different plan instead?


If you decide you want to change health insurance plans after you've enrolled
in one plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can do so as long as
it is still in the open enrollment period and the coverage hasn't started (known
as the "effective date").


Once your health coverage begins, you'll have to wait
for the next marketplace open enrollment period to change plans.


In certain cases, you may be able to enroll in a plan at a time that is not the
official marketplace open enrollment period.


Through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can shop online and get help by
phone or in person to find the health plan that works for you and your family.


The marketplace allows you to compare plans and costs on an "apples-to-apples"
basis.


You also can find out what kind of financial help you may be able to get
to pay for premiums and copayments.


For example, for coverage in 2016, an
individual with a household income between about $11,800 and $47,100 or a family
of four with a household income between about $24,300 and $97,000 would qualify
for financial help.


While
people with very limited incomes will receive the greatest help, moderate-income
families can often get help too.


Do I need to report any changes in my household status, such as an increase in
income, to the Health Insurance Marketplace?


For example, if your income has
increased, reporting that change will reduce the chance that you'll have to pay
back money at tax time.


Examples of life changes that could change the coverage and financial help you
may qualify for include:



     Moving to a new area

     Losing health coverage, such as job-based coverage

     Change in citizenship or immigration stats

     Change in income, such as getting a raise or losing a job

     Change in household status, such as getting married

     Change in family size, such as a birth or death



 For more details about when and how to report any life changes go to
www.healthcare.gov or call the Health Insurance Marketplace at 800-318-2596.


How long can my child remain on my family health insurance plan?


You can keep your children on your family health plan until they turn age 26,
even if they don't live at home, are married or attend school.


If your health
plan charges more for each child you cover, you may have to pay an additional
amount to add your older child to your plan.


It is important to know that not
all employers have to offer a family plan.


Check with your employer for the
details about adding your adult child to your family plan.


The Health Insurance Marketplace open enrollment (November 1, 2015 through
January 31, 2016) is the time when you can apply for a new health plan, keep
your current plan, or pick a new one.


Keep in mind that states
may have different deadlines for picking a plan and reporting changes (such as
income or household size) to make sure you don't have a gap in coverage and are
getting the right financial help.


What do I do if the marketplace health insurance plan I had last year is no
longer available?


If the plan you purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace is no longer
available, your health insurer must tell you about plans available to you,
including one that will be similar to the one you have now.


You can compare
plans and shop for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace during the
open enrollment period (November 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016).


You also
might find that your plan is still available outside the marketplace; however,
you will not be eligible for financial help if you enroll in that plan.


Financial help is only available for plans offered through the Health Insurance
Marketplace.


Do
I need to re-enroll in the plan for next year?


People who signed up for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace
should receive a notice from their health plan and another from the marketplace
about renewing health coverage.


The notices include information about coverage,
including any changes to your plan, financial assistance for the following year,
and the marketplace open enrollment period--November 1, 2015 through January 31,
2016.


Some people will be automatically re-enrolled in the same or a similar health
insurance plan for 2016.


In either case, it is important that you check with
your marketplace and review your health plan for 2016 to make sure it works for
you and your family.


You must report any changes in income or household size to the marketplace
where you enrolled to be sure you are getting the right financial help for your
family.


Keep in mind most people will need to make changes to their plan and
update their household information by December 15, 2015 to make sure coverage
starts January 1, 2016.


If you re-enroll in your
health insurance plan after December 15, 2015, your new coverage will not start
January 1, 2016.


Where should I go to buy my
plan?


But financial help is only available
with plans bought through the Health Insurance Marketplace.


Does my health insurance plan have to cover certain benefits?


As of 2014, all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small
employers must cover certain important health care services, known as essential
health benefits (EHB).


The ACA makes sure health plans can't deny you coverage because of health
problems you had before your insurance started (known as pre-existing
conditions).


Can my health plan limit how much they will pay toward my covered services?


No, health plans cannot put a dollar limit on how much they will pay for
covered services you receive in a year (annual dollar limit) or over the total
time you are enrolled in the plan (lifetime dollar limit).


Previously, plans
could limit the amount they would pay for covered services, for example,
$100,000 in a year or $500,000 over the life of the policy.


It's important to
know that health plans can still include other limits not tied to the cost of
benefits.


For example, your health plan may set a limit on the number of
physical therapy visits it will cover.


What can I do if my health insurance plan denies my claim for health benefits
that I thought would be covered by the plan?


The ACA strengthens your right to file an appeal if your health plan will not
pay for a medical service you received or won't give you prior approval for a
medical service you need.


Before the health care law, your right to appeal your
health plan's decision, known as an internal appeal, varied greatly, depending
on the state in which you lived.


Also, most people in employer health plans
didn't have the right to request an outside review of their internal appeal.


If your plan denies your claim for health benefits, they must
provide you with information on the steps you can take to appeal that decision
and how to get help doing it.


The ACA sets a limit on how much of a share of the costs you will have to pay
for health care in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.


The most
you can pay out-of-pocket in 2016 is $6,850 for an individual plan and $13,700
for a family plan (the amount will rise slowly, year to year, with inflation).


And, this limit only applies to
costs you pay for care you receive from an in-network provider and for essential
health benefits, which will probably be most health services covered in your
plan, but not necessarily all of them.


How can I compare health plans offered in the Health Insurance Marketplace?


Plans sold in the Health Insurance Marketplace are offered in four different
tiers, sometimes called "metal levels," so it's easier to make
"apples-to-apples" comparisons among plans.


The tiers--bronze, silver, gold and
platinum--are based on how generous the health plan is for the benefits and
services covered.


Bronze plans will have the lowest premiums, but the
individual's share of costs such as deductibles and copayments will be higher.


Platinum plans will have the highest premiums, but fewer additional costs for
consumers.


The actuarial value is based on what an average group of consumers
might pay under the plan, but your own costs may vary depending on how much care
you need.


All health plans sold to individuals and small businesses will fit into one of
these levels of coverage.


This will make it easier to compare plans to find one
that works for you and your family.


To be considered affordable, an
employee's share of the monthly payment (premium) can't be more than about 9-10
percent of their household income.


Can I buy a health plan outside the Health Insurance Marketplace open
enrollment period?


Also, health
insurance companies can choose to sell their plans at times other than the
marketplace open enrollment period.


In certain cases, you may qualify for a "special enrollment period,"
which will allow you to enroll in a plan at a time that is not the official
marketplace open enrollment period.


After I sign up for a health plan in the Health Insurance Marketplace, can I
change my mind and sign up for a different plan instead?


Once I buy one plan can
I change my mind and switch?


If you decide you want to change health insurance plans after you've enrolled
in one plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can do so as long as
it is still in the open enrollment period and the coverage hasn't started (known
as the "effective date").


Once your health coverage begins, you'll have to wait
for the next marketplace open enrollment period to change plans.


In certain cases, you may be able to enroll in a plan at a time that is not the
official marketplace open enrollment period.

Priced Out of ACA Plans, Millennials Seek More Affordable Health Insurance
Options

LENGTH: 597  words


Nov. 19 -- As premiums for Obamacare plans continue to rise, millennials are
seeking more affordable options in the term health insurance market.


Average premiums for Obamacare exchange plans increased by double digits from
2015 to 2016.


Bronze plans, which are generally the least expensive type of
Obamacare plan, had premium hikes of 11 percent in 2016.


Given that term health
insurance premiums were substantially less expensive than unsubsidized premiums
for Obamacare bronze plans in the 2015 plan year, AgileHealthInsurance examined
premiums for term health insurance and Obamacare plans to determine how prices
compare for 2016.


The analysis compared only term plans with lower deductibles
and out-of-pocket caps than the average bronze plan.


On average 30-year-olds would pay 28 percent less for their term health
insurance than for an Obamacare bronze plan, even when the cost of paying a
penalty is included.


Term health insurance plans are not qualified health plans
under the Affordable Care Act so enrollees in term insurance plans have to pay
the Obamacare uninsured penalty unless they qualify for an exemption.


For a household
income of $20,450, a 30-year-old male paying the uninsured penalty would save
$76 a month with term insurance and a 30-year-old female would save $47 a month.


Average premiums for Obamacare bronze plans were compared to average
premiums for term insurance plans available on AgileHealthInsurance.com.


Term health insurance plans are a compelling alternative for dissatisfied
Obamacare consumers who struggle with the cost of those plans.


Term insurance
plans have broader provider network coverage than most Obamacare plans so
enrollees can go to most doctors and still be covered.


Out-of-network coverage
is available in 100 percent of term insurance plans sold on
AgileHealthInsurance.com.


Term health insurance represents a distinct category of health insurance and
does not provide identical coverage as Obamacare plans, and benefit and
eligibility differences contribute to the cost savings observed.


Consumers apply
and, depending on their health status (including pre-existing conditions), they
may or may not be eligible for specific plans.

Thousands in New Mexico allowed to keep, extend health policies

LENGTH: 828  words


Thousands of New Mexico residents with existing health insurance plans that
don't meet the new federal health insurance law won't have to get new policies,
at least not immediately.


Some can get an extension until Dec. 31, 2014, and some can stay on their
current health insurance plans indefinitely if the company doesn't make any
changes to the policies.


Those existing plans were "grandfathered" in and
don't have to meet the new federal law requirements.


Those plan-holders will see their rates increase 10.2 percent next year.


Those
members with grandfathered plans also can choose to get a new health insurance
plan directly through an insurance company or through the federal health
insurance exchange website.


Another 11,000 Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico health insurance
policyholders, most of them self-insured through the individual market, don't
have plans that are "grandfathered" in.


They will have to purchase new policies
through Blue Cross Blue Shield or the health exchange because their existing
plans have to be terminated or changed to meet the new federal health care law,
according to Kinney.


Individuals with "non-grandfathered" plans can renew their
existing policies by Dec. 1.


After that, they will have to select a health insurance plan
that complies with the Affordable Care Act.


Janice Torrez, vice president of external affairs for Blue Cross Blue Shield of
New Mexico, said the company "wanted to give clients the greatest amount of time
to decide whether they wanted to stay with their plans or get into the federal
health insurance exchange."


People who keep their non-grandfathered health insurance plans for another year
will see a 9.2 percent increase beginning Jan. 1, 2014.


Lovelace Health System also asked for extensions through next year for
policyholders on some of its existing individual plans, according to state
Insurance Superintendent John Franchini.


"It gave people on individual plans
more time to select a new one," Franchini said.


Many New Mexicans with individual policies through Presbyterian Healthcare
Services have received notices that their policies will be canceled because the
plans don't comply with the new federal health law.


Aaron Ezekiel, who is managing the health insurance exchange for the Office of
Superintendent of Insurance, said insurance companies could grandfather in plans
that didn't comply with the Affordable Care Act, as long as they made no changes
to those policies.


"If they had plans that were going to expire in April, they could
extend the plan until Dec. 31, 2014.


He said the grandfathered policies are typically "closed block," meaning no new
members are accepted to the plan.


"Older plans have all kinds of limitations, particularly in the individual
market," he said.


Ezekiel said it doesn't make sense for insurance companies to try to make older,
closed-block plans comply with the new federal health care law.


"Closed-block
plans with mostly older and sicker members adds a whole lot more liability," he
said.


"If a whole group is age 60-65 and they are getting sick, you are not
doing them a favor to keep on an old plan.


But switching plans never makes people happy."


New Mexico Health Connections, Molina Healthcare, Presbyterian, Lovelace and
Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico are all offering health insurance plans
through the federal health care exchange.

will see a 9.2 percent increase beginning Jan. 1, 2014.


Lovelace Health System also asked for extensions through next year for
policyholders on some of its existing individual plans, according to state
Insurance Superintendent John Franchini.


"It gave people on individual plans
more time to select a new one," Franchini said.


Many New Mexicans with individual policies through Presbyterian Healthcare
Services have received notices that their policies will be canceled because the
plans don't comply with the new federal health law.


Aaron Ezekiel, who is managing the health insurance exchange for the Office of
Superintendent of Insurance, said insurance companies could grandfather in plans
that didn't comply with the Affordable Care Act, as long as they made no changes
to those policies.


"If they had plans that were going to expire in April, they could
extend the plan until Dec. 31, 2014.


He said the grandfathered policies are typically "closed block," meaning no new
members are accepted to the plan.


"Older plans have all kinds of limitations, particularly in the individual
market," he said.


Ezekiel said it doesn't make sense for insurance companies to try to make older,
closed-block plans comply with the new federal health care law.


"Closed-block
plans with mostly older and sicker members adds a whole lot more liability," he
said.


"If a whole group is age 60-65 and they are getting sick, you are not
doing them a favor to keep on an old plan.


But switching plans never makes people happy."


New Mexico Health Connections, Molina Healthcare, Presbyterian, Lovelace and
Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico are all offering health insurance plans
through the federal health care exchange.

8 features to look for when you buy a health insurance plan

LENGTH: 1000  words


, Jan. 2 -- A health insurance plan has become inevitable in today's era of sky
rocketing medical expenses.


A step forward - and an important one - is selection of an ideal health
insurance plan, when there is gamut of them available today.


Some of them have
really unique features, but there are some common features available in all
policies which you must compare before finalising any health insurance plan.


Sub-limits on Room Rent
 Room Rent is one of the major expenses you have to bear if any member of your
family gets hospitalised; so some general insurance companies cap the maximum
amount that they will pay under their health insurance plan.


But there are various general
insurance companies which do not have any maximum limit on room rent, so you
should look for such health insurance plans.


Pre-Existing Diseases
 Pre-Existing Diseases are those which you are suffering from before opting to
buy a health insurance plan, and therefore insurance companies do not cover them
from day 1 of your policy.


Therefore, you should look for health plans which will
cover your existing disease and have the least number of years of waiting
period.


Co-payment
 Co-payment is a clause in health insurance plans that requires cost-sharing by
the policyholder.


For instance, suppose you have a health insurance plan which has a
20% co-payment clause; so in case you are hospitalised and your claim amount is
Rs 1 lakh, then you as an insured would be liable to bear Rs 20,000 (Rs 1,00,000
* 20%), while the rest-Rs 80,000-would be settled by the insurance company.


Hence, ideally you should look for health insurance plans which do not have any
co-payment clause at any stage of your life.


You should ideally look for health insurance plans which have the maximum
number of network hospitals, and more importantly, maximum number of good
network hospitals in your city.


So you should
look out for health plans which cover you for maximum number of days of pre and
post hospitalisation period.


Exclusions
 Once you buy a health insurance plan, you might feel relaxed that you have
covered you and your family against any possible hospitalisation in future.


So before finalising on any health insurance
plan go through its exclusion and select the one which has least number of
exclusions and are clearly defined.


Premium
 Premium you would pay is a vital aspect you should consider while buying a
health insurance plan; but mind you, it shouldn't be paramount in your selection
process.


Just think, you buy a health plan with a very low premium without even
taking into consideration the features of the policy.


PersonalFN believes that, if you keep in mind these features while selecting a
health insurance plan, you may not regret having made wrong choice in the
future.


We also believe that you should buy it from a reliable insurance agent
rather than directly from the insurance company, as there is no difference in
premium between direct and regular plans.


Having an optimal insurance
coverage is integral in the exercise of financial planning, which helps you to
put your personal finance in order and aids you achieve long-term financial
goals.


You will pay no income tax on the money you use to buy health insurance, which
could be equal to a 30 percent discount on your monthly premiums.


You also will be eligible for state subsidies that will be set based on your
household income.


But that subsidy hasn't been determined, nor has the total
cost of the health plan.


If you or a member of your family has a health insurance plan offered through an
employer but can't afford it, the employer's contribution to your health plan
will instead be given to the Connector.


There will be no deductible for anyone between 100 percent and 300 percent of
the poverty line, but there will be a monthly premium.


For anyone under 100 percent of the poverty line -- which is $9,800 for an
individual -- there will be no deductible and no monthly premium.


You will be able to buy health insurance
through the new Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector, and will be able to buy
the same plan as small businesses.


You will be able to pay for health insurance using pre-tax dollars -- the same
way you might contribute to a 401(k) plan or a Health Savings Account.


Both individual and family plans will be available.


Those who
don't will lose their state income-tax exemption in the first year, which could
cost you $189 as an individual or $378 as a couple.


The second year, you will be
assessed half the annual cost of one of the new, low-cost health plans.


Also, if the state concludes that there are no affordable health plans, the
penalty will not be enforced.


If you do not participate in a
health insurance plan at work and are not covered by a parent's plan, you will
have the option of signing up for a special insurance program for people 19 to
26.


The plan has not been created, but the idea is that it will be a stripped-down
insurance offering that will be significantly cheaper than traditional health
insurance, in part because 19- to 26-year-olds are a healthier population.


Also, the new law allows people to stay on a parent's plan for up to two years
after they no longer qualify as a dependent.


So if your mother or father has a
health insurance plan and is already paying a family rate, it would be cheaper
to stay on that plan as long as possible.


And if you have 50 or fewer employees, you also will be able to use the state's
new Health Insurance Connector to buy insurance, which should give you easy
access to cost-effective plans and make them more attractive to your employees
by allowing them to spend pre-tax dollars.


At the same time, hospitals have been passing on the costs of treating the
uninsured to health insurance plans by building the expense into the rates they
charge insurers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield.


You will not be directly affected by the law and
will continue to be covered by Medicare or private health insurance plans.

eHealth Enters 2017 Obamacare Open Enrollment Period with Powerful New Health
Insurance Comparison Tool that May Save Shoppers Thousands

LENGTH: 973  words


Nov. 1 -- Today eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) (eHealth.com), the nation's first
and largest private online health insurance exchange, marks the beginning of the
Affordable Care Act's nationwide open enrollment period for 2017 with a broad
selection of plans, insightful customer resources, and a new drug coverage
comparison tool that can help shoppers save money on their prescription drug
needs.


"When comparing 2017

eHealth offers a broad selection of 2017 Obamacare-compliant health insurance
plans*

For the ACA's 2017 open enrollment period, eHealth has planned to offer access
to more individual and family health insurance plans than any other private
online marketplace.


Unavailable on government-run exchanges, these non-subsidy
major medical health insurance plans meet ACA requirements and can protect
consumers from 2017 ACA tax penalties if they maintain their enrollment through
2017 without a gap of more than two consecutive months.


According to data reported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, consumers
shopping for Obamacare-compliant plans outside of government exchanges may find
more bronze and gold-level plans available, as well as more PPO (Preferred
Provider Organization) and POS (Point of Service) plans to choose from[3].


eHealth makes Obamacare easy for 2017*

eHealth's consumer-focused plan comparison and enrollment website provides
consumers with an easy way to find the individual and family health insurance
plans best suited to their needs and budget, and to enroll in coverage online.

their 2016 health insurance plan through eHealth can easily reshop for new plans
if their 2016 health insurance plans are no longer available or will no longer
meet their needs in 2017.


eHealth's website
is fully mobile-responsive, allowing shoppers to review personalized health
insurance quotes and enroll in the plan of their choice through a mobile device.


* The ability to find out which plans are accepted by specific doctors.


Many
consumers with preferred doctors and hospitals are wary of switching to plans
that may require them to change medical providers.


Based on network information
provided from the insurance companies, eHealth allows consumers to search for
plans accepted by specific primary care physicians or specialists.


* Comparison tools that make it easy to narrow down your choices - Consumers can
save money on health insurance by shopping from a broad selection of plans and
finding the best match for their needs.


eHealth allows shoppers to make detailed
comparisons of up to five plans at a time.


It also allows them to sort their
plan choices based on doctors-in-network, monthly premium, annual deductible,
coinsurance, plan type, metal level, and now based on coverage of specific
prescription drugs.


eHealth offers customer support and resources that make a difference

Health insurance is a complex product and many consumers find the process of
selecting a health plan for themselves or their family stressful and
overwhelming.

India Network Visitor Health Insurance Announces Premium Changes for Visitors
Health Insurance Coverage from Feb. 1, 2015

LENGTH: 403  words


Jan. 27 -- US-based India Network Foundation issued the following news release:

India Network Foundation, a US based non-profit sponsor of visitor health
insurance in the USA announced today changes to health insurance plan premiums
effective February 1, 2015.


India network health insurance plans have managed to
keep the same premium for the last five years while medical costs continue to
increase in the United States.


For example many health insurance plans offered
on Healthcare.gov were increased more than 50 percent over their 2014 rates by
almost all insurance companies.


India Network plans offer a choice of
deductibles, pre-existing and new medical conditions coverage, medical
evacuation, repatriation benefits, and $25,000 accidental death benefit.


India network visitor health insurance plans differ from many other plans
offered in the United States in its coverage of inclusiveness of pre-existing
conditions.


Insurance coverage to those conditions alone is contributing
increasing claims costs of plans.


Dr. KV Rao, Founder and President said that "India Network believes in providing
consumer friendly health insurance plans that really pay all claims.


Though we like to keep the same premiums, it is impossible
with the current plan provisions with our ACE comprehensive PPO plan.


At the
same time, our members benefit from reduced premiums for fixed benefit plans
that have lower costs.


New green card holders with diabetes or high blood
pressure or any other medical condition are taking advantage India Network
health plan with pre-existing condition coverage until a suitable option is
found."


India Network Health Insurance Plan web site is fully automated for review of
plan designs, premiums, and to purchase plan through online application in a

Japan's immigration bureau to verify visa applicants have social security health
insurance

Effective in April, expatriates working in Japan will need to furnish proof that
they are covered under the statutory health insurance plan in Japan in order to
renew their visa.


The obligation to enroll employees and their dependents in the social security
health insurance plan is not new, but up to now it has been loosely enforced.


Under Japanese law, all residents of Japan - including foreigners - must be
covered under one of the two social security health insurance plans:

1.


Employed persons who work more than 20 hours per week for a company with more
than five employees must be covered under the Employees' Health Insurance plan.


A company is permitted to contract out of the EHI
and establish a plan that meets the requirements of a Health Insurance Society.


Up to now, some employers only have maintained health insurance coverage for
their expatriate employees and their dependents under a private health insurance
plan - often the plan in the employee's home country or an expatriate plan.


Companies may have felt that providing health coverage to non-nationals under
the Japanese social security plan was unnecessary and expensive (about 4.1% of
payroll for the company and an equal amount for the employee).


Some temporary assignees may be exempt from participation (typically
for no more than five years) under bilateral social security agreements, but
requirements vary by country.


You can
learn all about health insurance, get free online health insurance quotes,
compare health plan prices and benefits side-by-side, choose from a large
selection of affordable health insurance plans from leading health insurance
companies, and apply for health insurance online.


We have created a place where
individuals, families, small groups, and students can choose the health
insurance plan that is right for them.


CheapArizonaHealthInsurance.com offers a
wide variety of health plans including individual and family Arizona health
insurance, group health insurance, HMOs, PPOs, POS, Indemnity plans, short-term
health insurance plans, dental health insurance, and international travel health
insurance.

Your Money: The high cost of health insurance

SECTION: PERSONAL FINANCE

LENGTH: 554 words


The amount you pay for health insurance will vary hugely, depending on the type
of cover you want.


Before you choose a health insurance plan, consider whether
you want to be able to claim for hospital costs only, or for day-to-day medical
expenses too.


Do you have children, or plan to have
a baby?


Figures are based on the Health Insurance Authority's (HIA) online
comparison of health insurance plans.


**1**Nick and his wife Annette are in their 30s, and plan to start a family
soon, so they want a plan with maternity benefits.


They also want cover for a
semi-private room in a private hospital, with no inpatient excess.


A total of 29 plans matched the couple's needs, with six plans from Quinn, three
from Aviva and 20 from VHI.


There was a difference of more than EUR 600 between the dearest and cheapest
plans, with the cheapest five options all from Quinn.


Prices for the 29 options
ranged from an annual cost of EUR 825 per adult for Quinn's Healthwise Plus No
Excess plan, to EUR 1,460.94 for VHI's Health Plus Extra plan.


She would like a
health insurance plan that provides cover for a semi-private or private room in
a public hospital, with no in-patient excess.


She does not require day-to-day cover, and is not interested in plans with
specific cover for children or maternity benefits.


According to the HIA's website, 14 health insurance plans match her criteria,
with two options from Quinn, one from VHI and 11 from Aviva.


The cheapest option
was Quinn's Essential First plan at EUR 485 per adult.


**3**Mairead is in her 50s, and wants prices for health insurance plans based on
a private room in a high-tech hospital.


As her children are now adults, she is not
interested in health insurance plans with cover for children or maternity
benefits.


Eleven health insurance plans match Mairead's criteria, with prices varying by
more than EUR 1,300 annually.


VHI's PMI 04 11 plan is the second-dearest of the 11 options at an annual cost
of EUR 3,222.

Insured Texans lack clear understanding of their health insurance plans

LENGTH: 775  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the
following news release:



  Texans who bought their own health insurance were less likely to understand
basic terms and how to use their plans compared with those who have Medicare,
Medicaid or employee-sponsored health insurance.


The report found that the percentage of Texans who bought individual health
insurance plans increased 78 percent (to 18 percent from 10 percent) from 2013
to 2015.


The increase includes 1.3 million Texans who purchased Affordable Care
Act marketplace plans.


However, researchers discovered that Texans who bought
individual plans were far less likely to understand basic health insurance terms
like "premium," "copayment" and "deductible."


But more than 42 percent of Texans who bought their own health
insurance plans said they didn't understand the same term.


"The unfortunate irony is that those with individual health insurance plans are
the least likely to understand the basic terms, but they have the greatest need
to understand them," said Elena Marks, EHF's president and CEO and a nonresident
health policy fellow at the Baker Institute.


The report found Texans who bought their own health insurance also had more
difficulty understanding how to use their health plans.


More than half (51
percent) said that they lacked confidence to understand how much it would cost
to go to care providers outside of their plan's network.


Nearly half (46
percent) said they didn't understand what counts as preventive services, many of
which are covered by health plans at no additional cost.


Researchers found that Texans with Medicare, Medicaid, military and
employee-sponsored health insurance had difficulty understanding basic health
insurance terms and how to use their plans; however, their lack of confidence
rates were about one-third lower than those for Texans who purchased individual
health insurance.


"The lack of understanding
about the basic financial and coverage provisions of health insurance plans can
lead to surprise and frustration.


"Those who've worked
diligently to expand enrollment in health coverage must help the newly insured
understand their plans."

health policy fellow at the Baker Institute.


The report found Texans who bought their own health insurance also had more
difficulty understanding how to use their health plans.


More than half (51
percent) said that they lacked confidence to understand how much it would cost
to go to care providers outside of their plan's network.


Nearly half (46
percent) said they didn't understand what counts as preventive services, many of
which are covered by health plans at no additional cost.


Researchers found that Texans with Medicare, Medicaid, military and
employee-sponsored health insurance had difficulty understanding basic health
insurance terms and how to use their plans; however, their lack of confidence
rates were about one-third lower than those for Texans who purchased individual
health insurance.


"The lack of understanding
about the basic financial and coverage provisions of health insurance plans can
lead to surprise and frustration.


"Those who've worked
diligently to expand enrollment in health coverage must help the newly insured
understand their plans."

Your Money: Get to know the market and save

SECTION: PERSONAL FINANCE

LENGTH: 942 words


With hundreds of health insurance plans to choose from, it can be difficult to
wade through all the information available and find the best plan for your
needs.


As prices spiral and consumers face bigger bills for health insurance, getting
to know the market, the range of plans on offer and the cover you need, could
help you to cushion yourself against rising costs.


In a community rated system
everyone pays the same premium for a given health insurance plan, the HIA's
guide explained.


When choosing cover, don't forget to consider corporate plans which, for similar
cover, are typically cheaper than the products marketed to the public by health
insurers.


All consumers are entitled to buy corporate plans, but have to find them first,
as insurers will not necessarily point consumers in the direction of these
plans.


The basic rule though is that if a plan is on the market, you can buy it.


Figures
are based on the Health Insurance Authority's online comparison of health
insurance plans.


She wants cover for a semi-private room in a private
hospital, and according to the HIA's online comparison, 178 plans fit the bill.


She's prepared to accept an in-patient excess, but is not willing to plump for a
plan with restricted procedures.


As Maria looks more closely at the plans that meet her criteria, she sees major
differences in the benefits on offer and the level of excess that applies.


-- Do you have children, or plan to have a baby?


.....

**Question time: The alternative provider**

If you can't afford health insurance, there are cheaper alternatives available,
albeit with less cover.


It provides cash plans, which help families to cover the cost of day-to-day
health bills, but do not cover hospital stays or the cost of operations.


**How do cash plans and health insurance differ?


**

Private health insurance covers in-patient costs in private hospitals, whereas
the benefits of a health cash plan are focused on everyday healthcare costs,
which often fills the gap that private health insurance doesn't cover.


**

A health cash plan is a low-cost scheme with payments starting from EUR 10.25 a
month.


**

For the first time in many years, HSF Health Plan increased premiums on some of
its plans from January 1, 2014.


We do not plan to make any further adjustments in the near future.


**

We are finding that companies are looking more closely at health cash plans as
an alternative benefit provision.

Consumers Unhappy with Obamacare Seek Alternatives

LENGTH: 536  words


Aug. 26 -- As a large percentage of enrollees express dissatisfaction with their
Obamacare coverage, AgileHealthInsurance.com is seeing growing interest in term
health insurance plans.


For millions of people, term health insurance plans can
represent a more affordable option than Obamacare or a bridge to this year's
Obamacare enrollment period.


According to a recent study from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, only
30 percent of Obamacare exchange enrollees are satisfied with their current
plans.


This satisfaction level is significantly lower than satisfaction levels
among enrollees in employer health plans, as well as enrollees in Medicare and
Medicaid.


Price is a key driver of dissatisfaction with Obamacare plans.


According to the
Deloitte survey, 35 percent of dissatisfied Obamacare marketplace enrollees felt
they were paying too much for their plan.


In addition to making premium
payments, enrollees in Obamacare plans can also pay high deductibles unless they
qualify for cost-sharing subsidies or pay for a high-end gold or platinum plan.


Consumers also complain their Obamacare plans do not include broad enough
provider networks.


A study by Avalere recently revealed that Obamacare plans
offered on exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act have 34 percent fewer
providers than commercial plans offered outside exchanges.


In response to Obamacare dissatisfaction, some consumers are turning to term
health insurance plans.


Term health insurance premiums for 30-year-olds, for
example, are over 70 percent less expensive on average than premiums for
unsubsidized Obamacare bronze plans.


Moreover, term health plans are known for
very wide provider networks.


Enrollment in these plans can be done throughout
the year, as opposed to predefined enrollment periods.


"We have seen a steady rise in consumers shopping for term health insurance
plans," said Bruce Telkamp, CEO of AgileHealthInsurance.com.


AgileHealthInsurance.com provides a free rate comparison tool that allows
consumers to review plans, benefits and costs online.


They also can enroll
online if they find a plan that meets their needs.

eHealth Launches New Short-Term Health Insurance Choices for Consumers Seeking
Quality, Temporary Coverage Outside of Open Enrollment

LENGTH: 732  words


June 4 -- Today eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) announced that it has launched new
eHealth-branded short-term health insurance products in response to increased
demand for short-term plans among consumers and a lack of diversity in the
short-term health insurance products previously available.


Applications for short-term health insurance plans at eHealth more than doubled
between 2013 and 2014, and the number of short-term health insurance
applications that were declined at eHealth more than tripled in the same time
period.


eHealth's new short-term health insurance plans, eHealth Plus Coverage
and eHealth Plus Guaranteed Issue, are designed to help meet this new demand.


These plans are underwritten by National Health Insurance Company (NHIC) and
provide enrollees with access to Aetna's Open Choice PPO Network, a network of
health care providers who agree to provide services for members at a
pre-negotiated, reduced rate.


eHealth's branded short-term plans will be available to consumers shopping for
coverage at eHealth.com in 36 states plus the District of Columbia: Alabama,
Arkansas, Arizona, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri,
Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico,
Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Utah, Washington D.C., West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.


"eHealth offers customers a wide selection of quality, affordable short-term
health insurance products from reputable insurers, but over the past year,
customers who missed open enrollment have consistently been asking for
short-term plans with comprehensive benefits that more closely resemble major
medical plans," said Gary Lauer, Chairman and CEO of eHealth, Inc. "We've worked
with NHIC to create plans designed to meet that need, and we will continue to
improve on products that carry the eHealth name."


Lauer continued, "We've also seen an increase in applications for short-term
coverage being declined, so we felt it was critical to offer a guaranteed-issue
short-term plan for shoppers who had previously been declined access to
short-term coverage based on their medical history."


New short-term health insurance plans available at eHealth:

1. eHealth Plus Short-Term Coverage 1000, 2500, and 5000 -- This plan comes in
three variations based with deductibles of $1,000, $2,500, or $5,000.


There is no coinsurance once the deductible is met.


2. eHealth Plus Guaranteed Issue Short-Term 3500 --This plan includes a $100,000
limit on medical coverage.


It provides enrollees with access to Aetna's Open
Choice PPO Network, has a $3,500 deductible, 20% coinsurance, and a $10,000
out-of-pocket maximum for covered medical services.


This plan is offered to
individuals and families who apply for short-term health insurance coverage and
have their initial application declined because they did not meet the insurance
company's underwriting requirements.


These general plan descriptions are qualified in their entirety by the actual
plan brochures and other plan documents available at eHealth.com for each plan.


Its e-commerce platforms organize and present health insurance
information in various formats that enable individuals, families, and small
businesses to research, analyze, compare, and purchase a range of health
insurance plans.


The company offers medical health insurance coverage, including
preferred provider organization, health maintenance organization and indemnity
plans, health savings account eligible health insurance plans, and Medicare
related health insurance plans, as well as ancillary health insurance plans
comprising short-term, dental, life, vision, and accident insurance plans.


It
markets health insurance plans through its Websites, such as eHealth.com,
eHealthInsurance.com, eHealthMedicare.com, Medicare.com, and PlanPrescriber.com,
as well as through a network of marketing partners.


The company also licenses
its health insurance e-commerce technology that enables health insurance
carriers and agents to market and distribute health insurance plans online; and
provides online sponsorship and advertising services.


The Hibernian Health Insurance Plan was launched in partnership with VIVAS
Health, the country's newest health insurance provider.


It also includes cover for all inpatient costs in
122 hospitals and treatment centres.

HII Simplifies Health Insurance Purchasing with AgileHealthInsurance.com

LENGTH: 504  words

DATELINE: Tampa, FL


Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ:HIIQ) (HII), a leading developer of
affordable health plans, today announced its newest line of business,
AgileHealthInsurance.com.


AgileHealthInsurance.com is a pioneering website that
makes it easy for consumers to purchase low-cost alternatives and supplements to
Obamacare health plans.


Obamacare plans will not be available again, without a qualifying life event,
until the 2016 open enrollment periods begins on November 15th and the earliest
that coverage can start for those plans is January 1, 2016.


A recent nationwide
survey by HII demonstrated that only one-out-of-five adults knew when the
enrollment period for Obamacare health plans ended.


As a direct-to-consumer division of HII, AgileHealthInsurance.com was created to
educate people about the benefits of Term Health Insurance and provide a fast
online process for purchasing these plans.


Term Health Insurance is a flexible
and low-cost alternative to COBRA and Obamacare health plans, for individuals
without expensive pre-existing health conditions.


Term Health Insurance can also
provide "bridge coverage" for periods between health plan coverage, such as
during periods of unemployment or during summer months for students.


Term health
plans offer consumers the flexibility to choose health plans with the benefits
that matter most to them and combine these benefits with unrestricted provider
networks that allow them greater choice in the doctors and hospitals they use.


"At AgileHealthInsurance.com, consumers can search for,
compare, and confidently purchase affordable and high-quality Term Health
Insurance plans from multiple insurance companies.


Specifically, the Association of Health Insurance Advisors, which is a part of
the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, is opposed to
having a government-sponsored health plan as an option within any health care
reform plan passed by Congress.


Such a plan would represent a major step down
the road toward a single-payer, government-run health care system, the Falls
Church, Va.-based group said.


So far, relatively little is known about the administration's plan for health
care reform.


But the AHIA is hoping to get the attention of Congress as those plans are being
developed.


During his election campaign, Mr. Obama called for health care reform that would
give Americans access to a government-sponsored health plan.


Nancy Ann DeParle,
director of the White House Office of Health Reform, has also called for a
public plan option, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services, has supported that position as well.


But public plans often are underfunded, Ms. Boyle said.


Under the
government-sponsored Medicare plan for the elderly and the Medicaid plan for the
poor, ``We've seen payments to providers cut,'' she said.


In addition, many people who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid aren't
taking advantage of the plans, Ms. Boyle said.


``Instead of creating another
public plan, we'd rather see enrollment in the existing public plans tackled,''
she said.


``He wants to work with Congress to enact health reform that will not only
cut costs and assure quality and affordable health care for all Americans, but
it will guarantee you your choice of plans and doctors, and it will enable you
to keep your current plan.''


But critics say that the creation of a public health care plan would likely mean
higher costs to those with private insurance as health care providers look for
ways to offset lower government payments.


If that happens, ``people will shift into the public plan because it is so much
less expensive,'' said Bill Foudy, president of Foudy Insurance Agency Inc. in
Los Angeles and president-elect of the AHIA.


``The costs in the private plan
would escalate and we would be out of business.''


Health insurance agents also are worried about plans outlined by Mr. Obama
during his campaign to set up government-run health care exchanges to provide
low-cost health insurance.


The combination of a public plan along with government-run health care exchanges
would lead to limited plan offerings and fewer outlets for consumers to buy
health insurance, predicted Roy Ramthus, president of HSA Consulting Services
LLC, a Silver Spring, Md., employee benefits consulting firm.


With HSAs, policyholders must buy health insurance plans with very high
deductibles.


If plan offerings and sales outlets are limited, it would likely result in less
of a role for health insurance agents, said Robelynn Abadie, president of Abadie
Financial Services LLC in Baton Rouge, and president of the AHIA.


``If it becomes a government plan like Medicare and you have a federal employee
who is just giving you paper to fill out, you don't have that personal touch,''
Ms. Abadie said.

Des Plaines aldermen delay health insurance vote

Des Plaines aldermen delayed a decision Monday on Mayor Matt Bogusz's plan to
reduce health insurance perks for city council members, setting up a potentially
politically-charged final meeting before voters go to the polls.


Aldermen voted unanimously to defer Bogusz's resolution, which cuts the
lowest-deductible health insurance plans.


The health plan costs taxpayers about $90,000 annually.


Two city unions have agreed to reduce the health insurance plan for members in
recent collective bargaining agreements, and nonunion employees will also no
longer have the plan available Jan. 1, 2018.


Dissenting aldermen argued Bogusz's plan is yet another example of the mayor
attacking fellow elected officials, and they questioned the timing of the
resolution.


Fifth Ward Alderman Jim Brookman, who said he's supportive of removing the
lowest-deductible health insurance, questioned the timing of the mayor's
resolution.


Chester, who recently tried
to change his health insurance plan with the city, said employees told him he
couldn't move to the lower-deductible plan in the middle of the year.


Des Plaines Mayor Matt Bogusz wants to cut the lowest-deductible
health insurance plan for city council members.


Aldermen voted Monday to delay a
vote on the plan.


There are many types of California health insurance plans out there.


When doing
your research, make sure you understand these important elements:

Deductibles and Out-Of-Pocket Maximums

* The deductible is the amount that must be met before the insurance company
starts to cover expenses.


For many routine visits like seeing a doctor, the
deductible is waived.


Once you
meet this maximum, the plan covers 100% of all bills for the rest of the year.


In-Network vs. Out-of-Network

* Depending on the type of plan you select, your coverage for in vs.
out-of-network will vary.


For instance, if you have a managed care plan, such as
a PPO or POS, then you have more flexibility to use different doctors and
hospitals depending on what you select.


Coinsurance

* This is the amount you are obligated to pay for covered medical services after
you have satisfied any co-payment or deductible requirements on your plan.


Prescription Drugs

* Not all plans cover drug benefits.


Make sure you check out the
prescription benefits and coverage amounts when looking at the different plans.


Emergency, Hospital and Outpatient Care

* Hospital and Emergency Care: Depending on which plan you choose, you might be
responsible for a copayment or coinsurance for being admitted to the hospital or
even an emergency room visit.

Student health plan lifts coverage caps // State, community colleges in one pool

BYLINE: Aaron Nicodemus

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg.

LENGTH: 534 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER


The following correction was published in the Telegram & Gazette on April 16,
2010:

Out-of-state students who attend state or community colleges are eligible for a
new health insurance plan.


Deval L. Patrick joined college presidents from throughout the
state at Quinsigamond Community College yesterday to announce a plan intended to
significantly improve the quality of health insurance available to students.


The new health insurance plan will eliminate caps for maximum coverage and will
cover the costs of emergency room visits, prescriptions and ambulance trips.


Approximately 11,000 students statewide are currently covered under health
insurance plans offered through the 24 state colleges and universities.


Starting in August, students who attend a state college or community college
will be eligible to enroll in the new health insurance plan, offered by Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.


Not eligible for the new plan are students
attending private colleges and universities in the state; out-of-state students
attending state and community colleges (SEE PUBLISHED CORRECTION); and part-time
students.


The majority of students who attend the state's institutions of higher learning
are covered under their parents' health insurance plans.


The health
insurance plan offered to students by state colleges currently limits coverage
to $100,000 per year; limits prescription drug coverage to $5,000 per year; and
forces students to pay 20 percent of the cost for a mental health visit.


Under
the new plan, those coverage caps will disappear, while a mental health visit
will require a $20 co-payment.


Under the new plan, there would be no coverage caps and all
surgeries, ER visits and ambulance trips would be covered.


The new health insurance plan improves students' coverage by about 15 percent,
according to Jon Kingsdale, executive director of the Commonwealth Connector
Authority, the agency created in 2006 to help all the state's residents get
health insurance.


The student health insurance plan is funded by student premiums and is not
supplemented by the state, he said.


The improvements came because all 24 state
institutions pooled their students under one plan, he said.

Premiums for Alternative Health Insurance Bought Outside Government Exchanges
Average $103 Month

LENGTH: 503  words


Nov. 10 -- New data released today by AgileHealthInsurance.com shows that 65
percent of term health insurance plans purchased by consumers on its website had
monthly premiums of $100 or less.


Plans with monthly premiums of more than $100
but at most $200 were also popular, accounting for 23 percent of health plan
selections.


The average monthly premium for term health insurance plans selected on
AgileHealthInsurance.com was $103.


The findings are based on term health
insurance plans purchased by consumers between Jan. 1, 2016, and Nov. 7, 2016,
on AgileHealthInsurance.com that had a duration of at least 30 days.


The average premium for term health plans available on AgileHealthInsurance.com
invite cost comparisons with those observed on HealthCare.gov, the government
marketplace for Obamacare plans.


Obamacare plans have broad benefits but have
very different costs based on whether an individual is eligible for a subsidy.


For 2016 plans on HealthCare.gov, the average premium with subsidies included is
only $106.


"Obamacare premiums have increased an average of 25 percent this year, making
finding an affordable plan more difficult," said Bruce Telkamp, CEO of
AgileHealthInsurance.com.


Term health insurance plans are a compelling alternative for dissatisfied
Obamacare consumers who struggle with the cost of those plans.


Term insurance
plans have broader provider network coverage than most Obamacare plans so
enrollees can go to most doctors and still be covered.


Out-of-network coverage
is available for term insurance plans sold on AgileHealthInsurance.com.


Term health
insurance does not provide identical coverage as Obamacare plans, and benefit
and eligibility differences contribute to the cost savings observed.


Consumers
apply and, depending on their health status (including pre-existing conditions),
they may or may not be eligible for specific plans.


Term plans often
include co-pays and deductibles that parallel Obamacare plans, as well as
lifetime maximums of $1 million or more.


There are many types of California health insurance plans out there.


There are way too many plans to choose from and it can become very intimidating.


Let us try to break down the basics of the types of plans in California that you
might come across.


These types of plans are one of the
most affordable in the marketplace.


This is also another affordable
individual health insurance plan that gives people access to all health care
providers within the network.


Additionally, you can also go out of network and
most plans will cover you for care as well.


Also, HSAs
have high-deductible plans which are primarily used as "just-in-case" insurance,
or catastrophic coverage for those unfortunate emergency events.


This is the monthly cost that you have to pay to maintain your
individual health insurance plan.


Some plans also offer quarterly payment
structures as well.


This is the amount of money that you are responsible for before
co-insurance kicks in on your individual health insurance plan.


Usually, the
lower the deductible, the higher your monthly premium.


This percentage is what your insurance carrier will pay after
you have met your deductible.

Sept. 06--An ill-fitting health insurance plan can have costly health and
financial consequences, and studies show that many Americans lack an
understanding of health insurance and how to use it to make beneficial
health-care decisions.


They come
in and they don't know even the simplest thing, like what a deductible is,
things that a lot of people take for granted."


Studies have shown that many people have low health insurance literacy, the
ability to find and evaluate information about health plans, determine what plan
is best for their needs and how to effectively use the plan once enrolled.


People also often think they know more about health insurance than they actually
do, and less than half of people review a plan's details before signing up for
coverage, according to the American Institutes for Research.


"That does hinder their ability to pick a plan because a lot of times all they
are seeing is the price of the plan," Graff said.


"They want whatever is
cheapest without understanding that that plan, if you actually go and use it, is
actually going to end up costing you more in the long run."


No matter the insurance plan, he encouraged people to do research and not
navigate the process alone, especially if they haven't had insurance recently or
have experienced changes.


When preparing to select a health insurance plan, Stern recommends people take
stock of their individual situation, including medical needs, anticipated
procedures or medications and provider preferences, as well as a plan's premium
and out-of-pocket costs.


"We don't want people to be surprised when they go to the doctor's office and
have a deductible and copay that's higher than what they were expecting," she
said.


Do your due
diligence during the open enrollment period to make sure you are getting the
plan that meets your needs and budget."


Every health insurance plan in the new Marketplace will offer comprehensive
coverage, from doctors to medications to hospital visits.


You'll know you're getting a quality health plan at a reasonable price, because
there's nothing buried in the fine print.


One application, one time, and you and your family can explore
every qualified insurance plan in your area -- including any free or low-cost
insurance programs you may qualify for, such as Medi-Cal or the Children's
Health Insurance Program.


You may be eligible for a free or low-cost
plan, or a new kind of tax credit that lowers your monthly premiums right away.


All health insurance plans in the
Marketplace present their price and benefit information in simple terms you can
understand, so you don't have to guess about your costs.


Starting on Oct. 1, you'll be able to enroll in a health plan through Covered
California.


Detailed information will be available about all the insurance plans
offered in your area.


You can sign up now atwww.CoveredCa.com to get email updates that will let you
know how to get ready to enroll in the plan of your choice.


If you have difficulty finding a plan that meets your needs and budget, there
will be people available to give you personalized help with your choices.


These
helpers aren't associated with any particular plan, and they don't receive any
type of commission, so the help they give you will be completely unbiased.


* When you switch to another plan.


You need to cancel the previous plan by
presenting your new insurance certificate (or a copy of it), along with the old
one, at your municipal office.


Requests to withdraw on the grounds that you either want to join a private
insurance plan or you consider the insurance premium too high will not be
approved.


Here are the key
elements:

- If a UPS employee is on the companyês plan and their spouse is employed at a
different company that offers health insurance, the spouse will no longer be
eligible for the UPS plan and must purchase insurance from their own employer.


- If a UPS employee is on the companyês plan and their spouse is not employed by
a company that offers health insurance (or isnêt employed at all, or is on a
government plan such as Medicare), then the spouse will remain on the UPS plan.


- The company estimates that of the 77,000 UPS employees who are enrolled in UPS
health insurance, about 33,000 currently have spouses enrolled in the plan.


- Spouses whose employers offer medical insurance but do not offer prescription
drug coverage or behavioral health benefits will not be allowed to remain on the
UPS plan.


- After the change, if a spouse shifts from being unemployed (and thus eligible
for the UPS plan) to a job with insurance coverage, they must drop the UPS
coverage and take their new employerês coverage.


- Children may remain on the UPS plan.


If both parents have plans from different
companies, the parents can choose which plan will cover their children.


Stepchildren who are children of a spouse being removed from the UPS plan may
remain on the UPS plan.


- The UPS memo specifically cited Obamacare as a factor in its decision:
"Limiting plan eligibility is one way to manage ongoing health care costs.


In reality, the only spouses that would be removed from the UPS plan would be
those that already had an option of purchasing employer coverage.


But Cruz ignores that the only spouses being kicked off the UPS plan would be
the ones who already had access to an employer-sponsored plan in their own job.

Student health plan lifts coverage caps;
State, community colleges in one pool

BYLINE: Aaron Nicodemus, TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg.


Deval L. Patrick joined college presidents from throughout the state at
Quinsigamond Community College yesterday to announce a plan intended to
significantly improve the quality of health insurance available to students.


The new health insurance plan will eliminate caps for maximum coverage and will
cover the costs of emergency room visits, prescriptions and ambulance trips.


Approximately 11,000 students statewide are currently covered under health
insurance plans offered through the 24 state colleges and universities.


Starting in August, students who attend a state college or community college
will be eligible to enroll in the new health insurance plan, offered by Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.


Not eligible for the new plan are students
attending private colleges and universities in the state; out-of-state students
attending state and community colleges (SEE PUBLISHED CORRECTION); and part-time
students.


The majority of students who attend the state's institutions of higher learning
are covered under their parents' health insurance plans.


The health
insurance plan offered to students by state colleges currently limits coverage
to $100,000 per year; limits prescription drug coverage to $5,000 per year; and
forces students to pay 20 percent of the cost for a mental health visit.


Under
the new plan, those coverage caps will disappear, while a mental health visit
will require a $20 co-payment.


Under the new plan, there would be no coverage caps and all
surgeries, ER visits and ambulance trips would be covered.


The new health insurance plan improves students' coverage by about 15 percent,
according to Jon Kingsdale, executive director of the Commonwealth Connector
Authority, the agency created in 2006 to help all the state's residents get
health insurance.


The student health insurance plan is funded by student premiums and is not
supplemented by the state, he said.


The improvements came because all 24 state
institutions pooled their students under one plan, he said.

CORRECTION: The following correction was published April 16, 2010:

Out-of-state students who attend state or community colleges are eligible for a
new health insurance plan.


It's estimated the
increase will bring in an additional $1,234 annually toward the plan.


The county has three plans
-- plans B, C and D. There are 10 people on plan B, three on C and the remaining
(57) are on plan D.

That being said, there will be no increase for those employees on plan D -- the
plan with a higher deductible and no employee contribution.


The 6.4 percent
increase only applies to plans B and C.

"I think in time, the way the industry is headed, everyone will have to be
contribute to their health-insurance plan," said Ron Riley, supervisor chairman.


"We're working right now to get everyone, including the union employees, on the
same year and same (health-insurance) plans.


It's a slow process, but eventually
we'd like to consolidate it to one or two plans and have everyone contributing.


I think it's a much more sustainable plan if everyone is contributing."

Govt plans to use funds for state-run health insurance

BYLINE: Yomiuri

The government and ruling coalition parties plan to ask corporate health
insurance unions and mutual aid societies of government employees to contribute
110 billion yen to top up the public funds needed for the government-managed
health insurance for employees of small and midsize companies.


In fiscal 2008, the government plans to reduce by about 110 billion yen the
public funds for government-managed health insurance for employees of small and
midsize companies.


Instead, the government and ruling coalition parties plan to ask corporate
health insurance unions for employees of major companies to contribute about 80
billion yen and mutual aid societies of government employees to fork over about
30 billion yen to the state-run health insurance system.


The plan is part of the government's efforts to cut social security expenditures
by about 220 billion yen in fiscal 2008, in line with reforms approved in fiscal
2006.


However, as the plan will require insurance premiums to be increased by about
5,000 yen, which will be footed equally by employers and employees, for each
union member per year, the health insurance unions vehemently oppose the plan,
making it difficult for the two sides to reach an agreement.


To meet the target of reducing social security expenditures by 220 billion yen,
the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry has a 100 billion yen reduction plan that
can be implemented by cutting drug prices and promoting the use of generic
drugs.


To make up for the shortage, it plans to reduce the more than 500 billion
yen in public funds it injects into the government-managed health insurance
every year by about 110 billion yen.


The National Federation of Health Insurance Societies, the central organization
of health insurance unions, opposed the plan, saying the government is trying to
shift the financial burden to corporate policyholders in an impromptu manner.


Taking into consideration the opposition of the national federation, the
government and ruling coalition parties plan to make the contributions a
one-year temporary measure for fiscal 2008 only.


Indeed, with more than 200 different choices of health insurance plans on offer
and ever-increasing premiums, the benefits of stepping back and reviewing the
choices you make have never been greater.


Private health insurance in Ireland also benefits from 20 per cent tax relief on
the full cost of the plan, regardless of the premium paid or a person's
earnings.


On September 1, VHI increased premiums by an average of 8.5 per cent across its
range of plans.


Its
most popular plan is Plan B.


Based on current premiums, a family of two adults and two children could expect
to pay &euro;2,266.46 for VHI Plan B, &euro;1,780.48 for Quinn Healthcare
Essential Plus and &euro;1,775.63 for Vivas Health We plan level 2.


The clear difference between the market leader and the two challengers is likely
to affect the choice made by people joining health insurance plans for the first
time.


The decision about who provides your basic insurance plan is the
fundamental one.


More than half the population
(52 per cent) has opted for private health insurance, and most have opted for
core plans from the three main insurers.


Considerations

Before buying private health insurance or reviewing your existing level of cover
or provider, consider the following points to allow you to make an informed
choice of cover that suits your needs:

* Do you understand the cover on offer from your existing plan or from the plan
you are considering?


For instance, the likelihood of requiring cardiac
surgery can be affected by inherited factors, and some plans do not cover the
top level of cardiac care.


Changing cover or provider

Under the 1994 Health Insurance Act, all registered insurers must accept members
from other registered insurers and give them credit for time spent with the
other insurer.


However, if you have been a member of VHI for the last ten years and decide to
move to a new plan with Quinn Healthcare, they will accept you as if you have
been ten years insured with them, and no additional waiting periods are imposed.


If you transfer to a new insurer or policy (even with same
insurer) with benefits superior to your old plan, you may be required to wait
two years if under 60 or five years if over 60 before the additional benefits
become available.


New breed of plans

Traditionally, private health insurance plans tended to provide excellent cover
for hospitalisation and very poor cover for day-to-day outpatient expenses, such
as visits to a GP or physiotherapist.


To this end, every insurer has devised specific plans that provide excellent
hospital cover with a guaranteed level of day-to-day outpatient cover.


These
allow people with regular outpatient expenses, such as those with young
families, to choose a plan with that specific cover.


VHI's Life Stage plans (such as First Plan Plus or Family Plan Plus), Quinn
Healthcare plans (Health Manager and Family/ Personal care) and Vivas Health's
Day-to-Day plans bought as an add-on to an existing 'Me', 'I'or 'We' level plan
are proving popular with new and existing clients.


These plans provide a guaranteed refund of a wide range of day-to-day outpatient
expenses, without having to exceed a high yearly excess.


Most such plans only
impose a &euro;1 yearly excess.


Dean of the
Graduate School Ben Ware today indicated that all graduate assistants will be
allowed to remain on the University-sponsored employee health insurance plan
until such time that a smooth transition is determined.


"University leadership met this week and decided all graduate assistants will be
allowed to remain on the University-sponsored employee health insurance plan
until a transition to the student health insurance plan is deemed agreeable by
representatives of both the GSO and the University administration," says Dean
Ware.


"We would like to work with graduate student leadership on an
implementation strategy that meets the health insurance needs of our entire
graduate student population, not only those who are eligible for the employee
plan because of their assistantships."


On March 19, the University announced that in accordance with the federal
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), the University would
be offering a new student health insurance plan for the 2015-16 academic year
and require that all full-time matriculated students carry some form of
ACA-compliant health insurance by fall of 2016.


The new University-sponsored Aetna
student health insurance plan has been designed specifically to meet the needs
of the University's entire student population, including international students
studying here in Syracuse and SU students studying abroad.


Students immediately affected by the new policy who enroll in the
University-sponsored student health insurance plan will have a premium that is
more than $1,000 less for better coverage than the student plan the University
currently offers.


Even those students who are not immediately affected by the
new policy but who enroll in the student health plan will see $175 in annual
savings next year when compared to the current plan.

Walmart Works with DirectHealth.com to Introduce Comprehensive Health Insurance
Program

LENGTH: 541  words


Oct. 6 -- US-based Walmart issued the following news release:

Recent research proves that more than 60 percent of people have difficulty
understanding their health insurance plan options and nearly 40 percent feel
they picked the wrong plan after enrollment.

enabling customers to compare coverage options and enroll in the plan that is
right for them whether that be a Medicare plan or Public Healthcare Exchange
plan through online, phone and in-store services.

The body, which
comprises all four private health insurers, has warned that the government's
plans to charge private patients the full cost of using public hospital beds
could result in health insurance premiums going up by 30%.


We
look at what health cash plans offer in terms of providing cover.


Health cash plans pay you cash towards the cost of a
wide range of everyday medical treatments such as GP and dentist visits.


The Hospital Saturday Fund (HSF) has been the dominant provider of cash plans in
Ireland with more than 100,000 customers but new players have entered the market
in recent years.


In 2012 GloHealth became the first mainstream health insurer to
offer cash plans.


Laya Healthcare launched its own range of cash plans last
month.


The HSF's family plans range in cost from (EURO)114 to
(EURO)972 annually.


The HSF's
family plans are not related to how many people are on your policy so children
are covered at no extra cost.


It also has cash plans aimed at individuals which
cost (EURO)156 to (EURO)624 a year.


GloHealth's Hospital Care plans for families cost between (EURO)249.50 and
(EURO)624 while individual plans cost between (EURO)187 and (EURO)468 annually.


Laya Healthcare's family cash plans cost between (EURO)248 and (EURO)550 a year.


Its individual plans range from (EURO)165 to (EURO)325.


Health cash plans are not designed to
meet the costs of hospital treatment.


Depending on the level of cover, the HSF's family plans pay (EURO)20 to
(EURO)120 for each night you stay in hospital up to 40 nights.


GloHealth's
Hospital Care plans pay (EURO)40 to (EURO)120 per night up to 20 nights.


Cash plans are primarily
intended to help cover routine healthcare costs such as GP visits, dental visits
and optical care.


Dermot Goode of
Healthinsurancesavings.ie, an adviser, said: "For people who can't afford health
insurance, and want to have something in place that gives refunds on routine
expenses, then cash plans are an option.


If you are buying a cash plan because
you think that it gives you a reduced level of health insurance cover, it
doesn't."


TOP TIPIt can make financial sense to take an excess on your health insurance
policy and use a cash plan to claw this back if you need to pay it.


The cheapest cash plan on the market costs (EURO)9.50 per month and
pays (EURO)20 for each night that you, your spouse or your children spend in
hospital so should cover part, or all of your health insurance policy excess
should you have to pay it.

Traditionally, health
insurance plans were indemnity plans; the insured paid a premium, the physician
provided health care services, the health insurance plan was billed, and the
health insurance plan paid for covered services.


As health care costs became
astronomical, health insurance companies developed different plans that were
aimed at providing quality health care at affordable prices.


Managed health care
became the buzzword for the health insurance industry, and health insurance
plans became more complicated.


Health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and
preferred provider networks, or PPOs, have largely replaced the traditional
indemnity health plan.


These health plans are similar in certain ways.


Both HMO and PPO plans
contract with health care providers to provide health care services at reduced

Navali & Company: Health Insurance Outlet: Guide for Buying Health Insurance

LENGTH: 397  words


New Delhi, March 27 -- Navali & Company, insurance agency and parent company of
Health Insurance Outlet, educates consumers on what to look for when buying
individual health insurance.


There are many types of California health insurance plans out there.


Here are
the top ten things to look for when buying individual health insurance:

1) Know What Benefits Are Important For Your Family

Once you run the health insurance quotes, you can filter the search results by
price range, deductible range, PPO or HMO, and health insurance carrier.


2) Comparison Shop

When you use our quoting system, we make it easy to drill down to the health
insurance plan that makes sense for you.


4) Pick The Right Deductible

Usually, the higher the deductible, the lower the monthly cost for the health
insurance.


5) Know Your Out-of-Pocket Maximum

Each plan has a maximum amount you will be responsible for each calendar year.


Do I need an HSA plan?


Most individual plans are
offered on a PPO basis, which means you can self-refer for your medical
services.


7) Who Needs The Coverage

Health insurance carriers also offer plans for families or children only.


If you
need coverage for your child because you are already covered, carriers offer
child-only plans that can save you some money.


8) Office Co-Pays

Some plans have a certain allowable amount of visits per year at a certain rate,
and then you have to pay a higher negotiated rate moving forward.


10) Read The Fine Print

If you do not understand a part of the health insurance plan, make sure you read
the full benefit details to learn about all the coverage and cost details.


Every health insurance plan in the new marketplace will offer comprehensive
coverage from doctors to medications to hospital visits.


You'll know you're getting a quality health plan at a reasonable price, because
there's nothing buried in me fine print.


One application, one time, and you and your family can explore
every qualified insurance plan in your area -- including any free or low-cost
insurance programs you may qualify for, such as Medicaid or the Children's
Health Insurance Program.


You may be eligible for a free or low-cost plan,
or a new kind of tax credit that lowers your monthly premiums right away.


All
health insurance plans in the marketplace present their price and benefit
information in simple terms you can understand, so you don't have to guess about
your costs.


Starting on Tuesday, Oct. 1, you'll be able to get detailed information about
all the marketplace plans available in your area.


You can sign up now to get email or text alerts that will let you know how to
get ready to enroll in the plan of your choice.


If you have difficulty finding a plan that meets your needs and budget, there
will be people available to give you personalized help with your choices.


These
helpers aren't associated with any particular plan, and they don't receive any
type of commission, so the help they give you will be completely unbiased.

and six of them will offer plans through the exchange's Small Business Health
Options Program market.

insurance plans for millions of people who currently have no coverage or whose
coverage is too expensive," said Covered California Executive Director Peter V.

City health plan raises costs for retirees

DATELINE: WORCESTER


Municipal and public school retirees enrolled in conventional city health
insurance plans will be paying more for their premiums starting Jan. 1, as well
as for office visits and prescription co-payments.


He said his reforms are intended to help put the brakes on the city's
skyrocketing health insurance costs, and align its health plans with trends in
both the public and private industry.


There are 4,431 retirees enrolled in health insurance plans offered by the city.


Of that total, 2,731 are in Medicare supplement plans.


Meanwhile, the remaining 1,700 retirees are in conventional active health plans,
such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield Blue Choice, Fallon Select and Fallon Direct.


Under those plans, the city picks up the tab for 87 percent of the premiums for
the Blue Cross plan it offers and 90 percent of the premiums for the plans
provided by Fallon.


Mr. O'Brien said the 1,700 retirees covered under conventional health plans will
be transitioned to a new plan design, which will have a higher contribution
rate.


He said change is needed to provide greater consistency within plan design for
all other participants, equity between retirees and employee groups and equity
between retiree groups.


According to Kathleen G. Johnson, the city's acting director of human resources,
those retirees on active employee health insurance plans will see a 3 percent to
4 percent increase in their monthly premium contribution rate, starting Jan. 1.


Under the plan, Mr. O'Brien said, the premium rates for the 1,700 retirees on
conventional health plans will still be more affordable than the Medicare
supplement plans.


As an example, the manager said, the Jan. 1 projected monthly premium for the
conventional Blue Cross and Blue Shield point of service plan will be $75.38.


Meanwhile, the retiree monthly contribution rate for the Blue Cross/Blue Choice
Medicare supplement plans is $93.50 for MEDEX and $89.66 for Managed Blue for
Seniors.


"The conventional plan is still more affordable than the Medicare plans," Mr.
O'Brien said.


He added that when the employee contribution rate for health insurance changes
to 20 percent on all active plans on July 1, 2006, it is projected that all
retiree premiums (active and Medicare supplement) will be consistent and
equitable.

Government health insurance plan will shut out 1.9 million

SECTION: HOME

LENGTH: 374 words


As many as 1.9 million people are at risk of being permanently frozen out of
health insurance, thanks to the government's new lifetime community rating
system, insurance industry experts have warned.


The government's plans - which are designed to bring young policy holders back
into the market, rebalancing the demographic skew - would see a 2 per cent
annual loading on top of the price of health insurance for anyone who takes out
a policy for the first time after the age of 34.


That could include a huge chunk of the 2.5 million
people who don't currently have inpatient health insurance policies.


According to figures supplied to The Sunday Business Post by the Health
Insurance Authority (HIA), the statutory regulator of the Irish health insurance
market, just over 2 million people in Ireland had inpatient health insurance
plans at the end of March 2014.


On the basis of the most recent CSO population estimate (of 4.6 million people),
that leaves around 2.5 million without health insurance plans, said Micheal O
Briain, head of regulatory affairs at the HIA.


This would ''indicate that the number of
people who have never been covered by inpatient health insurance plans is
approximately 1.9 million people, O Briain said.

eHealth Welcomes 2016 Obamacare Open Enrollment Period with New Offerings,
Tools, Resources for Health Insurance Shoppers

LENGTH: 1011  words


Nov. 1 -- Today eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) (eHealth.com), the nation's first
and largest private online health insurance exchange, marks the beginning of the
Affordable Care Act's nationwide open enrollment period for 2016 by highlighting
its health plan offerings and consumer resources designed to help Americans find
the best coverage for their needs and budget.


"With new plans to choose from, an improved mobile enrollment experience, and a
powerful new drug coverage comparison tool that could save consumers thousands
of dollars, eHealth is making Obamacare easy for the 2016 open enrollment
period," said Bill Shaughnessy, eHealth's President and COO.


Some 2015 plans are going away while others are
raising rates or reducing benefits.


Coverage under new 2016 health insurance plans selected during open
enrollment may begin as early as January 1, 2016, depending on the date when
consumers submit their applications and on the policies of individual insurance
companies.


eHealth is ready to enroll consumers in coverage

eHealth is entering the 2016 open enrollment period ready to enroll individuals
and families in a broad range of ACA-compliant health insurance plans.


eHealth offers a broad selection of 2016 health insurance plans

For the ACA's 2016 open enrollment period, eHealth plans to offer access to more
individual and family health insurance plans than any other private online
marketplace.


For unsubsidized consumers in particular, eHealth expects to have
more than 3,800 non-subsidy plans from more than 100 insurance companies across
the country.


Unavailable on government-run exchanges, these non-subsidy major
medical plans meet ACA requirements and can protect consumers from 2016 ACA tax
penalties if they maintain their enrollment through 2016 without a gap of more
than two months.


eHealth makes Obamacare easy for 2016

eHealth's consumer-focused plan comparison and enrollment website provides
consumers with an easy way to find the individual and family health insurance
plans best suited to their needs and budget, and to enroll in coverage online.


eHealth's new drug coverage comparison tool will allow consumers to
enter their personal drug regimen and find plans that cover their prescription
drugs most affordably based on data from insurance companies and other sources.


* Streamlined plan renewals for existing customers.


Consumers who purchased
their 2015 health insurance plan through eHealth will be able to easily reshop
for new plans if their 2015 health insurance plans are no longer available or
will no longer meet their needs in 2016.


eHealth's website
is now fully mobile-responsive, allowing shoppers to review personalized health
insurance quotes and enroll in the plan of their choice through a mobile device.


* The ability to look up which plans are accepted by specific doctors.


Many
consumers with preferred doctors and hospitals are wary of switching to plans
that may require them to change medical providers.


Based on network information
provided from the insurance companies, eHealth allows consumers to search for
plans accepted by specific primary care physicians or specialists.


* Comparison tools that make it easy to narrow down your choices - Consumers can
save money on health insurance by shopping from a broad selection of plans and
finding the best match for their needs.


eHealth allows shoppers to make detailed
comparisons of up to five plans at a time.


It also allows them to sort their
plan choices based on doctors-in-network, monthly premium, annual deductible,
coinsurance, plan type, metal level, and whether office visits are covered
before or after the deductible.


eHealth offers customer support and resources that make a difference

Health insurance is a complex product and many consumers find the process of
selecting a health plan for themselves or their family stressful and
overwhelming.


During open enrollment, eHealth plans
to answer questions and help consumers by telephone, email, and online chat
using its staff of licensed insurance agents and knowledgeable representatives.


You can learn all about health insurance, get free online health
insurance quotes, compare health plan prices and benefits side-by-side, choose

Bobby Jindal's Tax Plan Would End the Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance
Exclusion

LENGTH: 748 words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: Tax Foundation has issued the following news release:



 Some of the features of Bobby Jindal's recently released tax plan - fewer tax
brackets, ending the estate tax, and eliminating itemized deductions - should be
familiar from other Republican candidates' tax plans.


But a few elements of
Jindal's plan stand out from the rest of the field.


Specifically, Jindal would
significantly change the tax treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance
plans.


Businesses are able to deduct the cost of health
insurance provided to employees, while employees are not required to report
health insurance benefits as taxable income.


During the 2008 campaign, candidate John McCain called for replacing the health
insurance exclusion with a health insurance credit - thereby requiring Americans
to report the value of health insurance benefits as income.


While Bobby Jindal has called for repealing the Cadillac tax, his tax plan
would include a provision similar in concept.


According to Jindal's website, his
plan would &ldquo;replace the exclusion for employer-based health insurance with
a standard deduction for health insurance costs whether they are provided by the
employer or purchased by an individual.&rdquo; This means that Americans would
be required to report health benefits as income, but would be able to deduct a
set amount of healthcare benefits every year.


However, this provision of Jindal's plan differs from the Cadillac tax in
several important respects.


While the Cadillac tax imposes a flat rate of 40
percent on the value of employer healthcare plans above a threshold, Jindal's
proposal would impose the rate of whatever tax bracket a household falls into.


In the case of Jindal's plan, insurance plans would likely be subject to a rate
of 25 percent, the top tax bracket that Jindal proposes.


In contrast, the Cadillac tax's thresholds are not indexed for
inflation, meaning that more and more healthcare plans will be subject to the
tax with each passing year.


If the deduction were indexed to overall inflation, Jindal's proposal
would also likely apply to an increasing number of plans every year.


This would be an
important structural shift in the tax treatment of healthcare: for the first
time, individuals would be required to report the value of their
employer-provided healthcare plans, even if they do not pay taxes on the
majority of it.


At least one other presidential candidate has called for changing the tax
treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance: Marco Rubio's healthcare plan
calls for setting the tax preference for health insurance &ldquo;on a glide
path&rdquo; and replacing it with a tax credit for healthcare.

Des Plaines aldermen delayed a decision Monday on Mayor Matt Bogusz's plan to
reduce health insurance perks for city council members, setting up a potentially
politically-charged final meeting before voters go to the polls.


Aldermen voted unanimously to defer Bogusz's resolution, which cuts the
lowest-deductible health insurance plans.


The health plan costs taxpayers about $90,000 annually.


Two city
unions have agreed to reduce the health insurance plan for members in recent
collective bargaining agreements, and nonunion employees will also no longer
have the plan available Jan. 1, 2018.


Dissenting aldermen argued Bogusz's plan
is yet another example of the mayor attacking fellow elected officials, and they
questioned the timing of the resolution.


Fifth Ward Alderman Jim Brookman, who said he's supportive of removing the
lowest-deductible health insurance, questioned the timing of the mayor's
resolution.


Chester, who recently tried
to change his health insurance plan with the city, said employees told him he
couldn't move to the lower-deductible plan in the middle of the year.

HII Simplifies Health Insurance Purchasing with AgileHealthInsurance.com

LENGTH: 715  words


May 5 -- Health Insurance Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: HIIQ) (HII), a leading
developer of affordable health plans, today announced its newest line of
business, AgileHealthInsurance.com.


AgileHealthInsurance.com is a pioneering
website that makes it easy for consumers to purchase low-cost alternatives and
supplements to Obamacare health plans.


Obamacare plans will not be available again, without a qualifying life event,
until the 2016 open enrollment period begins on November 15th and the earliest
that coverage can start for those plans is January 1, 2016.


A recent nationwide
survey by HII demonstrated that only one-out-of-five adults knew when the
enrollment period for Obamacare health plans ended.


As a direct-to-consumer division of HII, AgileHealthInsurance.com was created to
educate people about the benefits of Term Health Insurance and provide a fast
online process for purchasing these plans.


Term Health Insurance is a flexible
and low-cost alternative to COBRA and Obamacare health plans, for individuals
without expensive pre-existing health conditions.


Term Health Insurance can also
provide "bridge coverage" for periods between health plan coverage, such as
during periods of unemployment or during summer months for students.


Term health
plans offer consumers the flexibility to choose health plans with the benefits
that matter most to them and combine these benefits with unrestricted provider
networks that allow them greater choice in the doctors and hospitals they use.


"At AgileHealthInsurance.com, consumers can search for,
compare, and confidently purchase affordable and high-quality Term Health
Insurance plans from multiple insurance companies.


When comparing premiums
for nonsmoking men and women ages 30, 40, and 50, a February 2015 study
published by AgileHealthInsurance found that Term Health Insurance premiums were
66% less expensive on average than unsubsidized premiums for Obamacare bronze
plans.


The terms of the agreement provide for the following:

* the corporate voluntary health insurance plan  covers up to 3,000 employees;

* the  health insurance premium paid by the NBU per employee amounts to UAH
3,300 for a full year coverage (half the average health insurance premium under
similar corporate health insurance programs);

* The insurance coverage amount (the total amount payable by the insurance
company for covered medical expenses in the event of a medical emergency) is UAH
100,000 per person per year.


* insured medical services are mostly provided by state-run hospitals and
privately-owned hospitals;

* this corporate health insurance plan provides  equal health insurance benefits
and  insurance coverage to all NBU employees ( grade of insurance "Classic"
regardless of the job position they hold).


Health insurance is voluntary, meaning that NBU employees apply to join the
health insurance scheme voluntarily and pay an income and a military tax.


A voluntary health insurance plan is part of the benefit package offered to
employees.

As people start shopping today for health insurance on the new marketplaces,
health insurance cooperatives will be among the companies offering plans.


"We are nonprofit, member-governed health insurance carriers that operate for
the benefit solely of the members," said David Lyons, founder and CEO of
CoOportunity Health, which will offer plans to individuals and small businesses
throughout Iowa.


"A lot of our members appreciate knowing it is their organization and they
really have a big hand in how we operate, how we are able to provide outreach to
the community at large, especially at historical points in health care like we
are now," said Jeanan Yasiri Moe, chief planning and innovation officer for
Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin, which offers plans to
residents in Lafayette and Iowa counties.


Newer co-ops in
particular cannot promise hospitals high patient volume in return for discounts
the way competitors can, a Kaiser Health News report said, adding that many
co-ops are "renting" provider networks assembled by competitors, which limits
the ability to negotiate.


Lyons said he believes health insurance co-ops will fit in well with other
providers under the new law.


Its product portfolio
includes motor third party liability insurance, blue casco insurance, navy casco
insurance, complementary health insurance, crystal plans, superb health
insurance, health insurance, eco health insurance, emergency health insurance,

The new tool, now available at
HealthMarkets.com, provides consumers with real-time quotes representing an
estimate of the premiums for health insurance plans offered on the site, and
includes in that calculation an estimate of any government subsidies that the
consumer may be eligible to receive.


Fasola continued, "With a superior online quoting experience at
HealthMarkets.com, customer phone support 24 hours a day, and a dedicated field
force with over 3,000 local health insurance agents, HealthMarkets can provide
the talent and tools necessary to help consumers compare health plans online,
over the phone and face-to-face."


Quoting is available across 44 states with 3,000 health plans from over 120
different insurance companies, enabling HealthMarkets.com to offer one of the
broadest selections of health insurance plans using a private consumer website.


Quotes include an estimated subsidy calculation for eligible consumers based on
the income figures they input so they can obtain more accurate prices on
available qualified health plans.


"This is just one more step we've taken to improve how consumers shop for and
compare health insurance plans.


With the addition of
the federal Web-Broker Entity (WBE) designation, we intend to provide enhanced
solutions for consumers looking to shop for, and enroll in, subsidy-eligible
health insurance plans," Fasola added.


Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), consumers have until March 31, 2014 to
enroll in a qualified health plan.


HealthMarkets can help consumers enroll in
plans that are on the federal or their state government's health insurance
exchange, in addition to health plans not available on those exchanges.


Health Ministry reports that
high overhead for Meuhedet and Leumit's supplementary insurance plans comprises
28% of their income.

LENGTH: 933 words


The overhead costs - on marketing, operation and administration - for supplying
supplementary health insurance comprised 28 percent of all income from members
who hold such extra policies from Kupat Holim Leumit and 25% from Kupat Holim
Meuhedet.


However, the supplementary health insurance plan of Maccabi - the second-largest
public health fund - was found to be in deficit for the second year in a row,
and its managers were instructed by the ministry's deputy director-general, Dr.
Yoel Lipschitz, for supervision of the health funds to reach a balanced budget
in the future.


Fully NIS 865 million, or 38% of the health fund's
supplementary health insurance policy income, went for operations and choice of
surgeons, in private hospitals or public hospitals with legal Sharap [private
medical service] services.


A surprising finding in the report is that fully 60% of those who receive
allotments for disability or old-age with income supplements have supplementary
health insurance.


Asked to comment, Maccabi management said "the report shows that our Maccabi
Zahav plan is the most worthwhile and efficient of all.


Maccabi leads with the
highest percentage of members who take advantage of this plan; 92% of payments
for this return to members for additional treatments and service."


The health fund added that many holders of its
supplementary health insurance plans use it for extra care for fertility
treatments and ultrasound scans for pregnant women that are not covered by
ordinary health insurance.


Lipschitz instructed Maccabi to increase the efficiency of its supplementary
health insurance plans, examine which services are not widely used and not to
raise its premium without permission.


Maccabi told the ministry it accepted a
three-year plan to cover its deficit.


Only a minority of holders of Meuhedet's top-level (more expensive) Si
supplementary health insurance plan actually received benefits, as the
"benefits" are not practical and not widely used, Lipschitz said.


So if the Si
plan is not made more realistic and attractive, the ministry could force the
health fund to cancel it.


A copayment of NIS 20 will be charged per child; this Leumit program
offers more options than the plan instituted by the ministry for children up to
the age of 10.


Leumit said its plan has "computerized national objective supervision of the
professionalism of dentists, care and prices" - the ministry's plan is not
supervised by independent authorities outside the ministry.

A look at what consumers should consider in selecting a health insurance plan

Purchasing insurance is a major financial decision regardless of need-- life,
home, farm, car and health, as examples.


Some will get a
plan through their employer, while others might go through a private insurer or
qualify for Medicare, TRICARE, Veteran's Affairs or KanCare, Kansas' Medicaid
program.


If you were uninsured in 2014, you will face a tax penalty when you
file in April 2015 of either $95 per person or 1 percent of annual household
income above the tax-filing threshold (about $10,000 for an individual),
whichever is greater.


"If you choose not to enroll in 2015, you will face a tax penalty when you file
in April 2016 of $325 per person or $975 a family, or 2 percent of annual
household income above the tax-filing threshold, whichever is greater," she
added.


"Not only does purchasing health insurance have the potential to improve our
health, but with health insurance, families are better able to plan for medical
expenses," Kiss said.


"They can budget for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses
based on the specifics of their plans."


A premium is a fixed monthly
expense you pay for your plan regardless whether you use your health insurance.


For example, a family of four with a household
income of less than $95,400 but more than $32,913 qualifies for some assistance.


Take time to choose a health insurance plan

Choosing a health insurance plan can be difficult, when you are trying to make a
decision based largely on unknown health care needs.


This is why consumers
should shop around to find a health insurance plan that best fits them and their
family and review several aspects of insurance policies before making a choice,
said Roberta Riportella, Kansas Health Foundation professor of community health
at Kansas State University.


Since health insurance plans change year to year, she said it is important to
review the details of your renewal contract.


This is true if you are obtaining
insurance from the Kansas Health Insurance Marketplace, your employer or other
provider.


The plans could change on items such as provider networks and
prescription drug coverage, as examples.


Before
examining the benefits in each plan, first understand your current health care
needs, and identify if you're at risk for a particular need within the next
year.


If you are purchasing health insurance in the marketplace, bronze level plans
will likely have the least costly premiums, and silver, gold and platinum plans
will have higher premiums.


You also may get a more complete plan that covers more benefits."


All adults under age 30 could consider catastrophic plans that are also sold in
the marketplace, she said.


"Consumers should be aware that premiums for those (catastrophic) plans could be
higher this year," Riportella said.


"The deductible is often the out-of-pocket
maximum, which is $6,600 for 2015.


"Some people over age 30 but in financial hardship might also qualify for a
catastrophic plan," she continued.


"We are
excited so many people were able to find a health insurance plan to fit their
needs and the needs of their family," said Amy Dowd, executive director of Your
Health Idaho.


The latest numbers released by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services show in all 76,061 Idahoans selected health insurance plans
through Your Health Idaho.


The Congressional Budget Office wanted to have 40,000 Idahoans select a health
insurance plan through Idaho's health insurance exchange during the first open
enrollment period.


When people enrolled in health insurance plans sold through Idaho's
health insurance exchange health insurance carriers paid a small assessment fee,
which was built into the price of plans and is put toward the operating costs of
Your Health Idaho.


At the most recent Your Health Idaho Board of Directors
meeting, the Board unanimously voted to keep the assessment fee at 1.5 percent
of a plan's premium.


The federal government collects a 3.5 percent assessment
fee on every health insurance plan sold through federally-facilitated
marketplaces.


With 76,000 Idahoans picking a plan during
Idaho's first open enrollment period, Your Health Idaho saved Idahoans $4.4
million by keeping the state's assessment fee at 1.5 percent in comparison to
the federal assessment fee rate.


If you want to see if you qualify
to sign up for a health insurance plan outside of open enrollment, call
1-855-YH-Idaho.


Your Health Idaho expects to get a more complete breakdown of the plan selection
number, including age demographics and the metal levels of plans selected from
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services toward the end of this week.

FLORIDA:Report: State Health Insurance Marketplace Plans Could Help More Smokers
Quit

LENGTH: 556  words

DATELINE: Jacksonville


Association of Lung Florida has issued the following news release:

If your health insurance plan covers quit-smoking treatments, you are more
likely to try to quit and be successful.


A new report from the American Lung
Association, "State Health Insurance Marketplace Plans: New Opportunities to
Help Smokers Quit," finds that the majority of health insurance plans and
policymakers are not taking advantage of the chance to help millions of smokers
quit.


State health insurance marketplace plans are required by the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) to help smokers quit as a free essential health benefit.


However, the
overwhelming majority of state health insurance marketplace plans are not
providing the coverage they should be for smoking cessation.


Millions of
Americans who have enrolled in health insurance marketplace plans should be
provided with free tools to quit smoking, but as the new report shows, fewer
than 20 percent of plan issuers are providing the appropriate coverage.


The report also shows that only 60 plan issuers out of 348 are covering tobacco
cessation medications with no cost-sharing as required in the ACA.


Fewer than
half of the plan issuers list the seven approved cessation medications on their
publicly available drug lists, or formularies.


Only one state, West Virginia,
had all plans in the marketplace covering all tobacco cessation medications.


This is a bright note, but it's important to know that West Virginia has only
one plan issuer selling plans in its marketplace.


What should plans cover?


According to the ACA and federal guidance, all plans should cover a
comprehensive tobacco cessation benefit:

At least four sessions of individual, group and telephone cessation counseling
    All FDA-approved tobacco cessation medications (nicotine patch, gum,
lozenge, nasal spray and inhaler; bupropion and varenicline)
    At least two quit attempts per year
    No cost-sharing, like copays, coinsurance or deductibles
    No prior authorization requirements.


The majority of marketplace plans are not only falling short of the guidelines
set by the federal government, but more importantly, they are also missing a
critical opportunity to help millions of Americans quit smoking.


Evidence also
suggests that smoking rates of people enrolled in marketplace plans are high,
which means that they are missing the chance to offer full cessation benefits to
those who may need it the most.


"Federal and state policy makers must make sure insurance plans are covering a
comprehensive cessation benefit with no-cost sharing.


State and federal policymakers should step in to
ensure plans are following requirements."


We help people compare
health insurance plans to make sure they are choosing the most affordable health
insurance option.


Our
website provides a platform where people can easily compare all health care
plans and health insurance prices.


In addition, we have licensed experts who are
always available to assist you with questions relating to all health insurance
plans and policies.


At Safe Health Insurance, it is our mission to ensure all
Americans have access to valuable information regarding low cost health
insurance plans and have access to affordable health care plans and services.

Top up now, move to bigger health insurance later

LENGTH: 1222  words

DATELINE: India


India, Sept. 19 -- As far as health insurance needs go, being covered under the
corporate group plan of your employer or buying a policy for a tiny sum insured
of, say, '1-2 lakh is not enough.


Medical costs have skyrocketed and the process to port health
insurance from a corporate plan to an individual plan is not smooth.


"Even as
porting from group plan to individual plans is allowed within the same insurer,
the purpose is defeated because your employer may decide to change insurers and
you will have to start all over again in terms of credits on waiting period,"
said Kapil Mehta, managing director, SecureNow Insurance Broker Pvt.


For such
individuals, a health insurance top-up plan is an excellent way to increase the
cover while keeping costs in check.


A top-up health insurance plan is a regular
indemnity plan that covers hospitalization costs but only after a threshold
limit is crossed.


In insurance parlance, this limit is called deductible.


A
deductible is that portion of the claim amount that is not covered by the
insurer and has to be paid by the insured person before the benefits of the
policy can kick in.


So, if you already have a health insurance policy or are
covered by your employer, the deductible limit can be paid by the employer's
policy and anything above that limit by the top-up cover.


Therefore, a better
strategy would be to have a regular health insurance that one can afford and
then take a top-up plan.


Since top-up plans are invoked only when the base cover
is exhausted, they are much cheaper than a regular indemnity cover of a similar
sum insured," said K.K.


Some have, in
fact, gone beyond the usual to offer an option of migrating from a top-up plan
to a regular plan.


"Although portability allows a person to port from a high
deductible without any fresh underwriting or loading and regardless of the
claims status," said Antony Jacob, chief executive officer, Apollo Munich Health
Insurance Co. Ltd. Mint Money reviews two such plans that were launched
recently.


Tata AIG MediPlus

This plan by Tata AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd is a basic top-up plan that
covers only "single incidence hospitalization".


In other words, if your hospital
bill exceeds the deductible limit during a single incident of hospitalization,
only then can you make a claim on the top-up plan.


For example, if a person gets
hospitalized and the bill comes to '5 lakh, a basic top-up plan of '3 lakh
deductible and '5 lakh sum insured will pay '2 lakh.


But in a year, if the
person gets hospitalized twice-the first time it costs him '2.5 lakh and '2 lakh
the second time-the top-up plan will not get triggered at all.


Even though the
total bill overshoots the limit of '3 lakh, each instance of hospitalization is
within the deductible limit.


MediPlus offers a fixed sum insured of '5 lakh with
a deductible option of '1 lakh- 5 lakh.


This means, if you choose a deductible
of '1 lakh, then for a single incidence of hospitalization will not cover you
(R) FROM PAGE 27 for the first '1 lakh and will subsequently cover you till '5
lakh.


This is called the waiver of
deductible option, which allows you to port to any regular indemnity plan by the
insurer.


In other words, you can port all the waiting periods from the topup
plan to the regular indemnity plan.


However, on porting, you will have to
conform to the new features of the indemnity plan and premiums.


Apollo Munich Optima Super

This plan by Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co. Ltd is a super top-up or
aggregate claims top-up plan that, unlike a single incidence plan, looks at the
aggregate claim to calculate the deductible.


Being a super top-up, in the
example mentioned before, this plan will pay '1.5 lakh, because two claims of '2
lakh and '2.5 lakh put together crossed the deductible limit of '3 lakh in the
year.


It also offers a sum insured from '5 lakh-10 lakh with a deductible
limit of '1 lakh going up to '10 lakh.


Even the waiver of deductible option is
slightly more flexible.


It allows an individual to migrate to the insurer's
regular indemnity plan in the sixth policy year, or any time between 55- 60
years, provided the insured bought the policy before turning 50.


"Waiver of deductible is a very good option for
those who are under a group cover.


While in the job, they can use the group
cover to cover the deductible limit and enhance their health insurance cover
through the top-up; on retirement, they can migrate their top-up policy to a
regular plan with full continuity benefits and no fresh underwriting," said
Jacob.


This plan also offers a floater option, which means that the top-up would
kick in if any family member exhausts the deductible limit.


For example, for a
deductible of '2 lakh and a sum insured of '5 lakh, the annual premium would be
'1,179 for a 35-yearold.


The same would cost '2,309 for Optima Super, but it
offers more flexibility and is an aggregate top-up plan.


"The concept of
allowing individuals to move to a regular health insurance plan is very useful,
especially for those who would have lost their group health insurance cover or
have no cover at all.


But these plans are restrictive as they allow conversion
only after a certain point," said Mehta.


In a year or so, we should see more
super top-up plans that will allow you to move to a regular indemnity plan more
frequently," added Mehta.


If you don't have a health insurance plan or have
negligible cover, you should first buy a regular health insurance policy and
then top it up with these plans, preferably a super topup plan.


Later, you can
always migrate to a more comprehensive health insurance plan.


Dean of the
Graduate School Ben Ware today indicated that all graduate assistants will be
allowed to remain on the University-sponsored employee health insurance plan
until such time that a smooth transition is determined.


"University leadership met this week and decided all graduate assistants will be
allowed to remain on the University-sponsored employee health insurance plan
until a transition to the student health insurance plan is deemed agreeable by
representatives of both the GSO and the University administration," says Dean
Ware.


"We would like to work with graduate student leadership on an
implementation strategy that meets the health insurance needs of our entire
graduate student population, not only those who are eligible for the employee
plan because of their assistantships."


On March 19, the University announced that in accordance with the federal
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), the University would
be offering a new student health insurance plan for the 2015-16 academic year
and require that all full-time matriculated students carry some form of
ACA-compliant health insurance by fall of 2016.


The new University-sponsored Aetna
student health insurance plan has been designed specifically to meet the needs
of the University's entire student population, including international students
studying here in Syracuse and SU students studying abroad.


Students immediately affected by the new policy who enroll in the
University-sponsored student health insurance plan will have a premium that is
more than $1,000 less for better coverage than the student plan the University
currently offers.


Even those students who are not immediately affected by the
new policy but who enroll in the student health plan will see $175 in annual
savings next year when compared to the current plan.

Many people do not realise that health
insurance providers have a wide range of products that very often provide
broadly similar levels of cover at different prices.


The HIA is also keen to emphasise that, in health insurance, all consumers have
significant rights regardless of their age or health and are entitled to
purchase any health insurance plan they wish.


It is important to be aware of the
right to purchase any plan that you wish because sometimes plans can have names
that make it sound like they are not universally available, but no matter what
the product is called all consumers are entitled to buy it.


The HIA provides information on all insurance plans and presents it in a clear
and customer friendly format that makes it easy to compare different plans.


So, by logging on to our website or
phoning us, consumers can find the plan that provides the level of cover that
they require at the best price.


By law, at your renewal date, you can switch your plan or your insurer even if
you are already ill and your insurer may only apply a waiting period in respect
of any extra cover that your new plan has.


Power and Associates Reports: Interest in Health Insurance Exchanges Grows
in Both the Individual and Group Health Insurance Markets

LENGTH: 922  words


New Delhi, March 13 -- Anticipating the impact of healthcare reform, nearly four
in 10 health plan members with employee-sponsored insurance say they would shop
for coverage through a health insurance exchange if they had the opportunity,
according to the J.D.


Now in its sixth year, the study measures member satisfaction among 141 health
plans in 17 regions throughout the United States by examining seven key factors:
coverage and benefits; provider choice; information and communication; claims
processing; statements; customer service; and approval processes.


A majority of health plan members who purchase insurance on their own indicate
they would likely use one of the state health insurance exchanges (55%), which
are conceived, in part, to address their needs.


However, a sizable percentage of
health plan members who are covered under an employer-sponsored program-39
percent-also indicate they would shop for insurance through an exchange if it
were available.


In
2012, only 37 percent of health plan members say they would not be likely to use
an exchange, compared with 50 percent in 2011 who expected to continue obtaining
coverage at work.


"Satisfaction among some
health plan members may be low enough that an alternative, direct retail model
could become more attractive than traditional wholesale purchasing by
employers."


The study also finds substantial interest among health plan members in private
health insurance exchanges, in which an employer might provide employees with
vouchers for purchasing health insurance independently.


Approximately 41 percent
of employer-insured health plan members indicate they would use this approach if
it were available.


It could mean more attention will be paid
to direct purchasers, and also make higher levels of satisfaction critically
important for health plans that strive to acquire and retain members."


"Health plans that excel in member satisfaction know how to create simpler
benefit designs that members perceive to be consistent and dependable," said
Millard.


"As health insurance exchanges take hold and consumer shopping for
coverage increases, it will become even more critical for plans to communicate
in clear and concise ways."


Health plan members in Michigan, the Illinois/Indiana region and Ohio are the
most satisfied with their health plan experience, while members in the Mountain
region and Colorado are the least satisfied.


Health plans ranking highest in their respective regions are (in alphabetical
order): Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut; AvMed Health Plans;
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois; Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Kansas City; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas; Dean Health
Plan; Geisinger Health Plan; Health Alliance Plan (HAP); Independent Health
Association; Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (which ranks highest California,
Colorado, the Northwest region, the South Atlantic region and the
Virginia-Maryland-Washington D.C., region); Medical Mutual of Ohio; and
SelectHealth.


Power offers the following tips to health plan members and consumers who
are shopping for health insurance coverage:

* Understand your coverage.


Health insurance plans are sometimes difficult to
understand, with complex rules for deductibles, co-payments, and other kinds of
expenses.


If you don't have a clear understanding of the coverage and you have a
choice of plans, opt for the simpler approach.


* Before enrolling in a health plan, familiarize yourself with online tools that
may be offered by your insurance company.


Some health plans are set up to offer
online services to track your medical condition, receive prescriptions, make
appointments, or even email your doctor.


More than one-half of health plan members who receive health
insurance at work are given only one option.


Member Health Plan Study is based on responses from more than
32,000 members of commercial health plans.

ACA Marketplace Enrollment Solutions: a Twenty-Something's Guide to Health
Insurance

LENGTH: 527  words


June 23 -- With the Affordable Care Act, twenty-somethings now have the
opportunity to remain on their parents' plan until they reach the age of 26.


1) Student Health Insurance Plans

Most colleges and universities offer student health insurance plans that you can
keep throughout your time as a student.


These plans typically end when your time
as a student does, so if you've recently graduated, make sure you find out until
when this coverage will last.


If you have questions about the
company's plan offerings and your eligibility, follow up with a Company HR
Representative.


Under the Affordable Care Act, waiting periods for these plans
cannot last longer than 90 days.


If you need a plan for the 90-day waiting
period, however, see if you can stay on your parents' plan for a few months or
check out option 4 (Short-Term Plans).


you turn 26 and your
parents' plan finally kicks you off, your full-time job becomes a part-time job,
etc.


), you become eligible for a 60-day special enrollment period for plans
offered on the Health Insurance Marketplace in your state of residence.


To
compare the premium (monthly cost), deductible and coinsurance (cost for health
services) and benefits (health services that are covered by the plan), you can
work with an agent (like the ones who work at ACA Marketplace Enrollment
Solutions).


They can even tell you about the special high-deductible
Catastrophic Plan available for people under 30.


These plans usually have lower
monthly premiums, but cover you comprehensively only in the event of a medical
crisis.


4) Short-Term Plans

Although Short-Term Plans are not considered minimum-essential health coverage,
these plans can provide medical coverage for health events that might come up
between coverage periods (e.g.


your parents' plan ends on July 1st and your
employer plan doesn't begin until October 1st).


As the name suggests, these
plans cover you for a short period of time and are typically not renewable after
they expire.


If you are confused about your options and want to know more, ACA Marketplace
Enrollment Solutions has a staff of licensed and certified agents who can walk
you through plan comparison on the Marketplace, explain complex terms like
deductibles and coinsurance, and even send you quotes for short-term plans.


Once
you choose a plan, you can work with your agent and new insurance carrier to
ensure you are using your plan in a way that meets your personal needs.

Susan Mitchell: Beware of cheap health insurance plans

BYLINE: Susan Mitchell

LENGTH: 466 words



HIGHLIGHT: The cheapest health insurance plans are of little use, and leave
consumers facing unexpected hospital bills


Beware of cheap health insurance plans.


Last year, this newspaper wrote about the proliferation of cheap health
insurance plans that doctors warned were effectively useless.


Many, if not most, of the cheap plans that have been launched over the past year
provide none of these benefits.


They are being sold for as little as [#x20ac]433 a year, and there are four
plans on the market for less than [#x20ac]500.


Dozens of these plans solely cover treatment in public hospitals.


Many other cheap plans require significant co-payments in standalone private
hospitals that can run to hundreds of thousands of euro.


The proliferation of these cheaper plans occurred after the previous government
introduced new rules that meant higher charges would apply to people who are 35
years or more when they first take out health insurance.


The cheap plans were launched in a bid to attract younger customers who wanted
to avoid the 'late levy'.


Some people may be inclined to dumb down to one of these cheaper plans, but you
really need to be spending at least [#x20ac]850 per year (for one adult) to get
a decent policy.


The researchers also found that 63% of the swing-state voters said malpractice
rules ought to be changed and that 61% said they had not heard enough from
current presidential candidates about reforming the medical malpractice
liability system.


When there was only VHI, there were less plans.


However, Goode pointed out that a lot of the plans on the market were    legacy
plans  , and not pushed by insurers.


There's an inertia factor and a fear
factor in the market that stops some people from moving off old, overly
expensive plans,   he said.


Having more plans now is partly because there are four providers (VHI, Aviva,
Laya and Glo), but also because of the growth in the corporate market.


It's hard
to escape proliferation in the health insurance market, Frawley said, when
insurers are developing bespoke plans for employers.


While some similar offers remain,
as well as discounts for signing up for cover online, the real value for
consumers, analysts say, is often found in plans designed specifically by
insurers for corporate clients.


Consumers can choose to purchase these types of
plan, as health insurers are legally obliged to sell the same products to
everyone.


Glo, which launched in 2012 and is the latest entrant to the health insurance
market, tried to keep things simple by unveiling a small number of core plans.


However, a couple of years on, the insurer has a much wider range of plans.


People can struggle to find details
of corporate plans and bespoke plans, but the HIA comparison tool has lifted the
lid somewhat,   she said.


According to Goode, health insurance plans follow a similar life cycle: a plan
is developed and marketed by an insurer, and then when it becomes too dear to be
sustainable, it is replaced, and overtaken by new plans.

With Obamacare Enrollment Over, Public Often Unaware of Premium Savings on Term
Health Insurance

LENGTH: 400  words


Feb. 19 -- AgileHealthInsurance released the findings today of a study comparing
the average premiums between Term Health Insurance and unsubsidized entry-level
Obamacare health plans.


When comparing premiums for nonsmoking men and women
ages 30, 40, and 50, the study found that Term Health Insurance premiums were
66% less expensive on average than unsubsidized premiums for Obamacare bronze
plans.


The reasons behind the premium differences include the broader mandatory
benefits of Obamacare plans and the lack of coverage for pre-existing conditions
for Term Health Insurance.


An overview of Term Health Insurance and its
differences from Obamacare plans can be found in the article "What Is Term
Health Insurance?"


A nationwide survey found only 40% of respondents were aware of Term
Health Insurance as an alternative to Obamacare health plans.


A separate survey
found that only 31% of respondents nationwide knew that Term Health Insurance
premiums were less expensive than premiums for entry-level Obamacare plans.

provide the requesting party the report, subject to Subsections (d), (e), and
(f).


The health insurance issuer is not obligated to provide a report under this
subsection regarding a particular employer or group health plan more than twice
in any 12-month period.


(b) A health insurance issuer shall provide the report of claim information
under Subsection (a):



 (1) in a written report;



 (2) through an electronic file transmitted by secure electronic mail or a file
transfer protocol site; or



 (3) by making the required information available through a secure website or
web portal accessible by the requesting plan, plan sponsor, or plan
administrator.


To withhold information in
accordance with this subsection, the health insurance issuer must:



 (1) notify the plan, plan sponsor, or plan administrator requesting the report
that information is being withheld; and



 (2) provide to the plan, plan sponsor, or plan administrator a list of
categories of claim information that the health insurance issuer has determined

federal law.


(e) A plan sponsor is entitled to receive protected health information under

(c) The health insurance issuer must respond to the request for additional
information under this section not later than the 15th day after the date of the
request under this section unless the requesting plan, plan sponsor, or plan
administrator agrees to a request for additional time.


MINIMUM REINSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE



 Any increase in the minimum reinsurance deductible must be approved by the
legislature.


Here's why:

* There are fewer major medical plans available.


* There are new restrictions on short-term health plans.


Short-term health
insurance plans provide a limited but valuable option for those who do not
qualify for or cannot afford major medical coverage, but new rules that took
effect in April 2017 reduced the maximum coverage period for a single policy
from 12 months to three months.


Mom & Dad's plan - When to say "Thanks but no thanks" - Current law allows
your parents to keep you on the family health insurance plan until your 26th
birthday, and many grads get covered that way.


However, buying coverage on your
own may make more sense if you live in a different city without access to the
network providers for your parents' plan or if you can save money by purchasing
coverage for yourself that better meets your personal needs.


Special enrollment periods - Use 'em before you lose 'em - If you want to
purchase a major medical Obamacare-compliant health insurance plan on your own,
you need to do so during the annual open enrollment period (which typically
begins November 1) or when you experience a "qualifying life event."


Obamacare subsidies - Understand the risks and rewards - As a single person,
if you earn less than about $48,000 per year, you may be eligible for government
subsidies when you purchase a major medical health plan.


This can make your
coverage significantly more affordable, depending on your income.


However, keep
in mind that your initial subsidy determination is based on your estimated
income for the year.


Proposals by Congressional Republicans
may change the way subsidies work, but income-based Obamacare subsidies are
still in place for now.


The penalty for 2017 is $695 per adult or 2.5% of your taxable income, whichever
is greater.


Other
insurance products that may be available year-round include short-term health
insurance plans, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, dental or
vision insurance, etc.


Coverage under products like these can be significantly more affordable than
major medical coverage, but keep in mind that these plans will not protect you
from Obamacare tax penalties and do not typically have Obamacare features such
as coverage for pre-existing conditions or the full set of minimum essential
benefits required by Obamacare.


Below, eHealth provides average premiums and deductibles for major
medical and short-term health insurance plans selected by eHealth shoppers aged
20-25 during the 2017 open enrollment period (November 1, 2016 through January
31, 2017).


These are aggregated averages for plans across the country, but you
can search for specific plans, premiums, and deductibles available to you in
your particular geographical area by visiting eHealth.com.


For major medical coverage:

* $231 was the average monthly premium

* $5,058 was the average annual deductible

* $161 was the average monthly premium for a catastrophic level plan

* $7,149 was the average annual deductible for a catastrophic level plan

* $362 was the average monthly premium for gold level plan

* $704 was the average annual deductible for gold level plan

"Catastrophic" plans tend to come with higher out-of-pocket costs and are
typically only available to people under age 30.


"Gold" plans provide the
second-highest level of coverage, in terms of cost-sharing, among
Obamacare-compliant major medical plans.


For short-term health insurance plans:

* $72 was the average monthly premium

* $6,024 was the average annual deductible

Short-term health insurance plans and other insurance products that are not
major medical plans provide limited coverage for a limited period of time.


It may be possible to be declined for such plans
due to a pre-existing medical condition.


Despite this, short-term plans and
other insurance products that are not major medical plans can still provide a
valuable level of protection against unexpected medical costs.

providers and resellers to market and distribute health insurance products

NDSU Offers Health Insurance Workbook

BYLINE: The Oakes Times staff

LENGTH: 277  words


The North Dakota State University Extension Service has a helpful Smart Choice
Health Insurance Workbook available to assist consumers as they make important
health insurance plan choices.


This also is the time that those people who were newly
insured in 2014 can renew their health plan coverage and subsidies.


An increasing number of North Dakotans are expected to enroll or renew policies
in health insurance plans during this open enrollment period.


"However, there are a few key dates consumers should be aware of when planning
their health insurance purchases for next year," Scharmer says.


Under the Affordable Care Act, uninsured individuals generally may enroll in
private, non group coverage plans or change plans only during open enrollment.


Jan. 1, 2015, is the earliest coverage can begin for a plan bought during the
open enrollment period.


People with qualifying events, such as getting married or having a baby, can
enroll in a health insurance plan at any time.


Consumers may purchase a qualifying health insurance plan through the federal
marketplace at http://www.healthcare.gov or through an insurance company or
agent.

Health Insurance Plans 'Too Complicated to Understand'

LENGTH: 1023  words

DATELINE: New York



Hartford:  Central Connecticut State University has issued the following press
release:
A new survey by experts at the Health Disparities Institute of UConn Health
shows that many patients across Connecticut are struggling to understand their
complex, jargon-filled private health insurance plans and even to use their plan
benefits correctly.


The researchers say today's complex insurance plans, with intricate cost
calculations and complicated language and terminology, can be very difficult to
understand, even for people with a college education.


-- Victor Villagra
Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act seven years ago, thousands of
Connecticut residents have enrolled in private health insurance plans through
the state's health insurance exchange Access Health CT. More people now have
access to essential health benefits through their plan, including inpatient
hospital care, mental health, prescription medication, and pregnancy and
childbirth care.


These observations of low plan use; news reports of surprise medical bills; the
fact that medical bills are the number one cause of personal bankruptcy; and
other difficulties in accessing health care, spurred the Health Disparities
Institute to study health insurance literacy rates, to see how to help more
patients use their benefits to achieve good health.


The Health Disparities Institute team is calling for a coordinated statewide
effort in collaboration with health insurance providers to simplify health
insurance plans and their language, and to begin an aggressive educational
awareness campaign to increase literacy.


The goal is to enhance patients' access
to the healthcare services covered under their plans, while avoiding the burden
of unnecessary costs.


Access to simpler, more consumer-friendly insurance plans should be a priority
in order to achieve greater health equity for Connecticut citizens."


-- Judith Fifield
The poll, conducted by phone during 2016, measured health insurance literacy
among 516 adult Connecticut residents enrolled in a qualified health plan
through Access Health CT, the state health insurance exchange.


The results
showed that this population struggled to understand basic health insurance
terminology, such as "premium," "deductible," and "co-pay," and how to use their
benefits.


"The first big
step is stepping-up our patient education to increase health insurance literacy,
and also to implement more consumer-friendly health insurance plans."


Key Connecticut Health Insurance Literacy Survey Findings
    Only 8 out of 13 questions (62 percent) regarding basic health insurance
were answered correctly;
     1 in 5 (20 percent) respondents did not understand the use of the insurance
word "premium;"
     2 out of 3 (66 percent) did not understand the word "formulary;"
     Only 1 in 3 (33 percent) could calculate their "out-of-pocket" cost of a
hospital bill when a "deductible" and a "copay" were part of the insurance
benefit;
     Only 4 out of 10 (40 percent) knew that "in-network hospitals do not always
have in-network doctors."


Fifield says that until now, there has been no information about the health
insurance literacy rates of Connecticut citizens enrolled in private health
insurance plans.

Where can I find information on buying a health insurance plan if I don't have
one with my employer?


Some states offer programs to the uninsured, such
as the Family Health Plus program in New York state, allowing individuals or
families with limited income to purchase their own plan.


Alternatively,
individual or family plans are offered at market rates through a number of
national and regional carriers.


Those looking for individual and family plans can also start their research at
Web sites such as www.healthdecisions.org and www.healthinsuranceinfo.net.


Those who buy health insurance on their own tend to be relatively price
sensitive since they absorb the entire cost of the plan themselves.


One New York-based nonprofit, the Freelancers Union, addresses a growing need
for plans not sponsored by a company and has plans to expand its services to
members outside New York.


In the coming months, Freelancers Union
plans to begin offering options to buy health insurance in the states with the
greatest demand.


She predicts that a growing number of individuals will begin buying their own
plans, leading to a "quintessential David and Goliath" problem where consumers
have no buying power and no ombudsman to help them navigate their medical
claims.

About 8,800 West Virginia residents stand to lose their health insurance because
of the Affordable Care Act's new requirements for insurance plans.


The health care reform law, passed in 2010, requires U.S. citizens to enroll in
health insurance but also includes a list of requirements for health insurance
plans.


Insurance providers must cancel or change plans that don't meet those
requirements.


Policyholders are eligible for new plans through the government's
health insurance marketplace, although that website has suffered crippling
technical problems since its launch last month.


Policy cancellations largely affect individuals who purchase their own health
insurance plans.


According to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the state Offices of
the Insurance Commissioner have received about 8,800 discontin- uation notices
for individual insurance plans.


President Obama, in his attempts to sell the Affordable Care Act to the American
public and lawmakers, frequently insisted people who liked their current health
care plans could keep them.


It's unclear how many people could lose their current health insurance plans
because of the rules changes.


The number of West Virginians losing their current health care plans is
relatively small.


While 8,800 are facing discontinuation of their policies, about 25,000 state
residents had individual health insurance plans in 2011, according to the latest
available data collated by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.


"Essentially those health plans were 'grandfathered' in.


If an employer had a
health insurance plan for his employees before the ACA was signed, you could
keep it," he said.


Potts said about 75 percent of BCBSND's employer groups decided to keep their
grandfathered-in health insurance plans.


"They found their employees like their health plans and want to keep them,"
Potts said.


For employers that didn't get their health insurance plans grandfathered, Potts
said those companies may find less-expensive plans through the health insurance
marketplace.


The cost-saving comes from an ACA requirement that the most
expensive rate for a single-payer plan can't be more than three-times the rate
for the least expensive single-payer plan, Potts said.


The coverage must be affordable as well, meaning the cost for the
employee only -- not including extra costs for insuring other family members
under the plan -- can't exceed 9.5 percent of the employee's wages or income.


"The good news for us is we will be playing an important role in registering
people, helping them enroll in health insurance plans under the ACA," he said.


This means North Dakota Residents who want to
enroll in a health care plan must do so through the federal government.

AgileHealthInsurance.com Expands its Leading Marketplace of Affordable Health
Insurance Options

LENGTH: 747  words


July 12 -- AgileHealthInsurance.com announced today it has launched a new
portfolio of health insurance products called "health benefit insurance plans."


Health benefit insurance plans are specially designed to help consumers who are
at risk for going underinsured or uninsured, in the absence of low-cost health
plans.


Many of the new health benefit insurance plans are priced under $100 a
month, a key price ceiling within the American health insurance market.


Unlike major medical plans, such as Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) insurance
plans or short-term health insurance plans, health benefit insurance plans pay a
set amount of money when the enrollee experiences covered medical events.


Depending on the health insurance benefit plan, this money
is paid directly to the enrollee to offset out-of-pocket costs or lost income,
or it is paid directly to the enrollee's health care provider.


Most health
benefit insurance plans offered on AgileHealthInsurace.com are not medically
underwritten, but they will not cover pre-existing conditions.


This means that a
consumer can apply without worry that the application will be rejected due to a
current health condition, but the plan will only pay for covered medical events
that occur after the application date.


Additionally, consumers can keep their health
benefit plan until they are Medicare eligible at age 65, and in some cases
longer.


"The reality of today's health insurance market is that we have a growing
segment of Americans who are locked out of Obamacare insurance plans due to high
premiums, ineligibility for government premium subsidies, lack of insurance
company participation or open enrollment restrictions," said Bruce Telkamp,
founder and CEO of AgileHealthInsurance.com.


We are very excited to be
complementing our market-leading short-term offering with a new online portfolio
of health benefit insurance plans.


We believe that the health benefit plan
category has the potential to become an important segment of the individual
health insurance marketplace."


AgileHealthInsurance.com offers health benefit insurance plans that provide
payments to help with four categories of medical expenses:

* Doctor office visits coverage: pays for a predetermined number of visits to a
doctor's office, as well as associated lab work

* Hospital visits coverage: pays for hospital admission due to illness or injury

* Accident coverage: pays when accidents result in an injury, such as a broken
leg or torn knee

* Critical illnesses coverage: pays in the event of a serious illness, such as a
heart attack or cancer

Many of the health benefit insurance plans offered at AgileHealthInsurance.com
have additional benefits such as a telemedicine service that provides 24/7
access to a doctor or nurse for basic medical consults and advisory services to
help consumers navigate the health care system.


All of the health benefit
insurance plans offered on AgileHealthInsurance.com have top ratings from AM
Best, ranging from B++ (Good) to A+ (Superior) in financial strength.


AgileHealthInsurance.com intends to continue investment and innovation within
the health insurance market, including expanding its health benefit plan
offerings throughout 2017.


AgileHealthInsurance provides a fast, online process for purchasing these health
plans.


Short-term health plans offer consumers the flexibility to
choose health plans with the benefits that matter most to them and combine these
benefits with broad provider networks.

Rx Lost in the passionate debate on President Obama's health care reform
initiative is that Congressman Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, has introduced his own
plan.


Unfortunately, Ryan's plan would make the health care crisis even worse by
shifting more power away from patients and to the health insurance industry.


Ryan's plan, H.R.


The first key feature of Ryan's plan, like the proposal John McCain advocated
during the 2008 campaign, is to tax health insurance benefits.


A report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concludes that Ryan's
plan would cause millions of Americans to lose their employer-based health
insurance.


The second key feature of Ryan's plan, as it clearly anticipates that many would
lose their health insurance at work if benefits are taxed, is to provide tax
credits of $2,290 for individuals and $5,710 for families to help them buy
insurance on their own.


Even worse, by forcing millions of people who now get their health insurance at
work to buy it directly, Ryan's plan would give the insurance industry greater
power to skim off the most profitable and healthy individuals, and to charge
discriminatory rates to everyone else for bare bones policies that expose them
to potentially bankrupting costs and treatment denials when they most need
medical care.


Ryan asserts that his plan would limit insurance industry abuses, but the
consumer protections in the bill are full of holes.


Worse, Ryan's plan would actually prohibit the new health insurance exchanges
from limiting premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses.


Ryan's health care plan also would eliminate Medicaid coverage for low-income
seniors, which helps them afford Medicare and services such as home health care.


In addition, it would force low-income families on Medicaid to go out and buy
health insurance on the private insurance market.


The whole thrust of Ryan's health insurance plan is to give the health insurance
industry more power to decide how much to charge, what medical services would be
covered, and what co-pays, deductibles, and benefit caps would apply.


In Oklahoma, HCR 1010, authored by Rep. Ron Peterson, R-Tulsa, and Sen.
Susan Paddack, D-Ada, empowered a Core Benefit Task Force to make
recommendations to the Legislature for the creation of a lower-cost, basic
health insurance plan.


Last summer, Holland announced the launch of a statewide series of community
meetings for the purpose of receiving input from Oklahomans about what services
should be covered under such a plan.


In the coming months, work on the state plan will continue.


The Insure Oklahoma/O-EPIC employer-sponsored insurance program pays part of the
health plan premiums for eligible employees working for businesses with 50 or
fewer full-time employees.


Legislation passed in 2004 authorized the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to
develop a program assisting adults age 19-64 who do not exceed 185 percent of
the federal poverty level with either a portion of their private health plan
premiums or the purchase of a state-sponsored health plan operated under the
state Medicaid program.


The site contains information
on options for the uninsured, private health insurance, insurance for high-risk
individuals and income-based health insurance programs.


Jana Kappel, office manager for W & W Tire, said worries about not having health
insurance prompted her to begin investigating health insurance plans for the
family owned and operated business.


Kappel said when she got quotes on the state plan from a local insurance agent,
she couldn't believe what she was hearing.


Terry Fisher said he got on the state plan in February 2007.


"It's an ideal plan," Fisher said.


Kappel said without the state plan she probably would not have insurance.


The health insurance market will be shaken up by the government's new lifetime
community rating system later this year, with the new plan designed to bring
younger customers back into the health insurance market in a bid to re-balance
the demographics of the market and stabilise the cost of private health
insurance.


As the details of the government's lifetime community rating plan emerged,
health insurance analysts predicted that insurers would launch new plans before
May geared towards people under 35.


These predictions proved correct with all
health insurers bringing new plans to market in recent weeks, designed to appeal
to younger customers.


More plans could follow ahead of the new rules, but
insurers must give 30 days' notice to the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), the
regulator for the private health insurance market, ahead of launching a new plan
.


These new plans - dubbed 'value pack' by some analysts - are considerably
cheaper than the other products on the market, but it's a case of you get what
you pay for, say market experts.


These plans
give you very little.


Prices for the new wave of plans start from EUR 409 for Glo's latest offering,
rising to EUR 425 for Aviva's new low-cost plan.


VHI's latest plan costs EUR 449
per adult, while Laya recently announced a EUR 430 health insurance plan.


In Goode's view, the latest range of plans to emerge from health insurers are
like riding a scooter when you want to drive a car  .


Anne Frawley, head of healthcare consulting at Mercer, described the latest
batch of plans from health insurers as    plans that tick a box  .


I'd expect that insurers will try
to upsell people other, more expensive plans,   Goode said.


Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry, is also
planning to run its own public awareness campaign ahead of the new rules.


Laya's recent research found that 62 per cent of those currently without health
insurance do not plan to take out a policy before the April 30 deadline, with
affordability - or a lack of it - cited as the main barrier to purchasing health
insurance cover.


The risk on these entry-level plans is that, if they don't get enough young
non-claiming customers in, they could take a hit,   Goode said.


According to Frawley, the risk for insurers is relatively small, given the basic
benefits on offer from the new plans.

Life insurers bank on private health plans

LENGTH: 519 words


Local life insurers are set to venture into the lucrative private health
insurance sector, anticipating that the new administration of President Lee
Myung-bak will accelerate the deregulation of the financial industry.


Korea's rapid demographic
changes and the consumers' desire for quality medical services have prompted
policymakers to seek ways to complement the public health insurance plans.


The nation's major life insurance players, including Samsung Life Insurance,
Korea Life Insurance and Kyobo Life Insurance, are planning to introduce private
health plans soon, industry insiders say.


A Korea Life Insurance official said
yesterday that the company plans to start selling private health insurance plans
within the next four months.


The full-fledged development of private health
insurance plans, without sufficient financial support from the public health
insurance scheme, could force insurance companies to raise their premiums, and
the price increase could eventually result in higher medical expenses, he
explained.


Wider coverage by private health plans could cause a "moral
hazard" by providing incentives for policy holders to claim unnecessary medical
expenses, he added.


For individuals, families,
students, employer sponsored small business group plans.

provides health insurance quotes, health insurance plans and dental plans
tailored to meet your needs.

Don't crowd out insurers;
Opposing view: Government plan would encourage employers to drop health
coverage.


Unfortunately, that's not
what would happen under his proposed health reform plan.


A major component of Obama's plan is a national health insurance exchange, in
which the government competes with private insurance.


In theory, everyone wins
-- the competition lowers rates and induces insurers to offer better plans.


In
reality, the presence of a large national plan would, perversely enough,
encourage employers to drop coverage (which is, after all, quite expensive).


In an October analysis, the Lewin Group, a leading econometrics
firm, estimated that Obama's plan would dramatically alter the way in which many
Americans are covered: 21.6 million would lose their private coverage, and about
48.3 million would end up in public coverage through the new government health
plan, as well as the State Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid.


Lewin estimated that 18.6 million employees would find themselves in the new
government plan, as employers switched from private health insurance.


At the very least,
we'd wind up with a highly regulated and painfully sluggish, centrally
controlled system in which private health plans and private medical practice are
private in name only.


And the artificially swollen and heavily subsidized government health
plan would remain as the benchmark for "private" decisions concerning financing,
benefits and standards within the new  health exchange.


And most American voters say they oppose any kind of
government-controlled plan if it means they'd have to change their own health
coverage.


Under Obama's plan, though, that's exactly what many would have to do.


He even accepted having co-payments for the health insurance plan
that he purchased.


They are patients who have bought cheap plans that
solely provide cover in public hospitals, or plans that require considerable
co-payments in standalone private hospitals.


Many are
purchasing cheaper plans.


A health insurance insider who spoke with this newspaper said insurers were
aware that some of these plans were of limited value, but said they provide many
30-40 year olds with an opportunity to get into the market and avoid any loading
that might occur down the line.


According to the Health Insurance Authority, there are 379 plans on the market.


Dermot Goode, a health insurance broker with Total Health Cover, said about 15
per cent of people with private health insurance are on these 'public only'
plans.


Consultant neurosurgeon Ciarán Bolger said people were    throwing away their
money   on plans that solely cover treatment in public hospitals.


These cheap plans really annoy me, as they are worthless,   said Bolger.


He said
he can provide quicker treatment for patients who have a health insurance plan
that covers the Hermitage Clinic - but not all do.


He also said that patients with cheap health insurance plans could find
themselves at a    disadvantage  , as public waiting list initiatives    favour
those without insurance  .


Some elective surgery is planned in the Mater because the magnitude of the
surgery necessitates access to the resources of the large teaching hospital.


Private hospital founder Jimmy Sheehan said the sheer number of    confusing
plans   was    an absolute nightmare   for doctors and patients.


Sheehan said that patients did not realise they were being sold a pup by health
insurers promoting cheap health insurance plans.


He said that co-payments - for
some health insurance plans - were often prohibitively expensive for patients
seeking care in private hospitals, and that this resulted in some patients with
health insurance being forced back into the public system.


Term Health Insurance is Best Option

LENGTH: 379  words


July 12 -- AgileHealthInsurance.com, the Internet's first site dedicated to
helping consumers understand the value of term health insurance, announced today
it has added additional plans for consumers seeking coverage outside of the open
enrollment period.


Term health insurance represents a distinct category of health insurance that is
generally more affordable than Obamacare plans or COBRA.


The average monthly
premium for term health insurance plans selected on AgileHealthInsurance.com is
less than $100.


Eligibility requirements and flexibility in benefits contribute
to the cost savings realized by consumers.


In addition, term health insurance
plans do not have the same narrow network limitations associated with many
exchange health plans.


Consumers can now compare term health plans from various insurers at
AgileHealthInsurance.com, including UnitedHealthcare, Everest Group, Unified
Life Insurance Co., Companion Life Insurance Co. and Standard Life.


Agile
customers can also enroll in Foundation dental and vision plans underwritten by
Nationwide.


"These plans offer
consumers a broad range of benefit options that help individuals and families
find affordable coverage they can purchase any time of year."


Unlike Obamacare plans, consumer applications are approved or rejected based on
health status, including the nature of pre-existing conditions.


SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 770 words


Nov. 15--Some local medical agencies plan to help ease the mind of folks who may
be confused or unsure about their health care future.


PharmaCare and University Medical Center plan to counsel and assist those who
need guidance when choosing a health care coverage plan under the new Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), known commonly as "Obamacare."


The law, which President Obama signed into effect in 2010, requires Americans to
be covered under a health insurance plan by Feb. 2015.


Nearly 10 million uninsured individuals enrolled in a marketplace
plan during the first enrollment wave, but 30 million remain uninsured.


"As a primary health provider in Wilson County, we want to help educate
residents in an easy-to-understand way, as well as assist those who haven't yet
signed up for health insurance or Medicaid, if qualified," said Matt Caldwell,
CEO of University Medical Center.


PharmaCare will provide a free Medicare consultation with a pharmacist to help
seniors pick the best prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan based on
their current list of medications.


The open enrollment period for choosing a Medicare plan is currently ongoing and
will end Dec. 7.


PharmaCare pharmacists will also help citizens by providing information to
compare plans within the ZIP code where residents live and give a printed review
of those plans.


In accordance to the ACA, all health plans on the
marketplace must offer a comprehensive set of benefits, and individuals cannot
be denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition.


There are five different
categories of plans, and exact prices vary depending on location, age, household
size and coverage desire.


Bronze plans are designed so that insurance companies will typically pay 60
percent of covered health care expenses with the remaining 40 percent to be paid
by consumers.


The consumer's expenses will be in the form of out-of-pocket fees
over and above the cost of the plan's monthly premium.


Silver plans (standard plans) pay 70 percent of insurance costs, and the gold
plans pay 80 percent.


The platinum plan is the most robust and pays 90 percent of costs and has the
highest premiums.


In all cases, the lower the premium, the higher the deductible
will be.


There's also the catastrophic plan offered only to those 30 and under or those
with the hardship exemption.


These plans contain very basic coverage and have
very narrow provider networks.


Anyone who can afford health insurance coverage but doesn't sign up may have to
pay a penalty of $325 per adult, $162.50 per child -- up to $975 per family or 2
percent of a family's income, whichever is higher.


People may qualify for exemption if: they're uninsured for less than 3 months of
the year, the lowest-priced coverage available would be more than 8 percent of
the household income, they're a member of a federally recognized tribe or
eligible for services through an Indian Health Service, and other reasons.

Medicare Open Enrollment Does Not Include New Health Insurance Exchanges, Says
Attorney With The Hale Law Firm

LENGTH: 380  words


The open enrollment period for Medicare has begun, when beneficiaries can sign
up for private health plans.


"During the open enrollment period, which runs from October 15 to December 7,
Medicare beneficiaries may sign up for Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare
Part D prescription drug plans," said Hale.


To add to the confusion,
many health insurance companies have used terms such as "silver," "gold" or
"platinum" for products they make available to Medicare beneficiaries, and now,
such terms are also being used for different health insurance packages available
on the exchanges.


One insurer, SummaCare, has changed the names of its Medicare Advantage plans
from silver and gold to sapphire and emerald, to help reduce confusion.


People on Medicare should make sure they are reviewing Medicare plans, not
marketplace options.


What people on Medicare can do during the open enrollment period is shop around
for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and all-in-one Medicare Advantage
plans.


Many Part D plans have increased co-payments or premiums, or changed

Medicare beneficiaries can shop for a new
plan or see what their options are by using the Plan Finder at www.medicare.gov

"The open enrollment plan is a good time for Medicare beneficiaries to shop
around," said Hale.

Ware surveys insurance;
 Committee eyes 3 different plans

- An ad hoc committee hopes payment incentives will entice some of the town's
full-time employees to change to a lesser-priced health insurance plan -- and
save the town money.


The success of the proposed plan is contingent on how many of the town's roughly
250 full-time employees might accept the coverage changes -- and that number is
unknown, they said.


In a report Tuesday to the Board of Selectmen, the ad hoc Health Insurance
Committee recommended the town stay with Blue Cross/Blue Shield health
insurance, but offer employees three Blue Cross plans at differing costs.


Instead of providing just Master Medical, at $689 a month for a family plan, the
committee proposed adding the less-expensive BlueCare Elect and HMO Blue plans.


The committee also recommended paying town employees whose insurance coverage is
provided through a spouse's employer to stay off the town's plan.


The stipend
payment would be 10 percent of the town's annual savings for every year the town
employee remains on a spouse's insurance plan: roughly $600 a year.


RETIREES' BENEFIT

Extending health insurance benefits to all retired town employees also could be
an incentive for present town employees to switch health insurance plans, the
committee said.


Under the committee's overall plan, selectmen would decide how many years an
employee must work to be eligible for retirees' health insurance, the committee
said.


Individuals currently in these three groups, including those with pre-existing
conditions, are expected to obtain full coverage for their pre-existing
conditions using plans available in the Open Market or on the new Nevada Health
Insurance Exchange.


In the past, it was common for individuals who completed COBRA continuation
coverage from their prior employer to sign-up for an individual HIPAA (Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) health insurance plan.


This Act requires individual health insurance companies to offer their two most
popular plans to those individuals that have completed their COBRA coverage.


The
monthly premiums that the insurance companies charge for HIPAA plans is
restricted by statute, but the general experience for most were high premium
rates.


Effective December 31st, 2013, all HIPAA plans in all states, including Nevada,
will come to an end.


PCIP
plans cover a broad range of benefits, including hospital visits, primary and
specialty care, and costs for prescriptions.


PCIP plans have a $2,000 annual
medical deductible, a $500 annual prescription deductible, and they pay 70% of
the in-network medical expenses after the deductible has been satisfied.


All PCIP plans in all states, including Nevada, will terminate on December 31st,
2013.


Members currently enrolled in PCIP are expected to make application for a
new 2014 guaranteed issue individual health insurance plan.

Health insurance: Things to keep in mind before opting for super top-up plans

BYLINE: Yashish Dahiya

LENGTH: 623  words


We are always worrying about the rising medical costs, irrespective of having a
basic health insurance cover or being covered by the company's group health
insurance scheme.


Well, it is here that a super-top plan comes to your rescue.


It works
over and above a deductible amount.


You are hospitalized and your medical bills costs R8 lakh
then the first R5 lakh will be paid by the group insurance while the remaining
R3 lakh will be borne by your super top-up plan (if you have it, otherwise you
have to pay the amount from your pocket).


What sets super top-up plans apart from top-up plans is that while the latter
takes overall bill amount into consideration, the former would pay only if your
claim amount crosses the threshold limit.


Money saver

Super-top plans are money saver as the premium on these is quite low.


Let's assume you have a base health plan
with Rs lakh sum insured and you intend to enhance it by R10 lakh.


You have
three viable options - take another health plan, increase current sum insured to
R15 lakh or opt for a super top-up plan instead.


Base cover

If you enhance your base health plan with a second health insurance plan, you
will have to pay an additional premium of R9,900 and should you choose to
increase your current sum insured to R15 lakh, you will have to pay around
R9,400 as premium.


In comparison, premium for super top-up plan will be as low
as R1,900.


People who want higher health insurance coverage without creating a big dent in
their pockets should consider buying a top-up plan along with the basic
indemnity plan.


If you are covered by group health insurance which has limits on
sum assured then you should consider buying a super top-up plan to secure
yourself from health emergencies.


If you think you can manage medical costs up
to certain limit but will require help if the costs go beyond a threshold then
just buy a super top-up plan.


Check the rules

With super top-up plans you can claim as many as times as you want till you
exhaust the sum assured.


However, it is imperative for you to check the disease
and treatment coverage of these plans.


You don't want to end up buying a super
top-up plan that won't cover the treatment you might undergo in future (as in
case of pre-existing diseases).


Thus, it is important to carefully scrutinise
what an individual plan offers and what are its exclusions.


This will help you
align the right plan to meet your needs.


Make the most of super top-up plans to secure your health at an affordable cost.


My law firm had a
health plan, and it was the only way we could afford new and experimental
therapies.


That insurance plan, the talented doctors and nurses, and the grace
of God saved Matt's life.


My plan is the only plan that provides
guaranteed health insurance coverage to all workers and the peace of mind that
comes with that guarantee.


My plan achieves the twin goals of universal healthcare coverage and significant
immediate economic stimulus to our troubled economy.


The plan uses proven,
existing private and public structures to extend health insurance coverage to
all Americans.


The plan is
paid for by repealing the Bush tax cut, replacing a failed economic plan with
universal healthcare and demonstrable economic stimulus.


Employers who currently don't offer health insurance would be required to offer
a quality health plan, and they'd receive a refundable tax credit equaling 60%
of the full cost of the premium - a tax credit they'd pass through completely to
their employees in the form of health insurance.


And for those employers who
currently do offer health insurance, my plan replaces the existing tax deduction
with a 60% refundable tax credit - a tax credit on the employer's share of the
premium.


Under my plan, employers who already offer health insurance would see an
immediate reduction in their overhead.


Under my plan, a working family of four
that currently has employer-based health insurance coverage would receive an
annual increase in wage and benefits of $1,800.


My plan is the right way to
stimulate the economy - not knee-jerk tax cuts that do nothing but pay off
George W. Bush's wealthy campaign contributors while killing economic growth.


My plan would also allow individuals between the ages of 55 and 64 to buy into
Medicare coverage at no cost to the federal government.


And we'll modify the SCHIP Program for uninsured low-income
children, expanding it to include their parents, and expanding efforts to find
those families that qualify.


My healthcare plan leaves no American on their own to bear the financial burden
of catastrophic healthcare costs.


Some will say my plan rewards companies that haven't been offering health
insurance.


First, my plan requires employers to spend 100% of the tax credit for employee
health insurance coverage.


Second, my plan is a greater value to working
families than the Bush tax cuts.


Not only will my plan provide working families
with guaranteed health coverage, it will provide stimulus that will put more
money in the pockets of every working American.


Third, any universal health plan
must not only address those who do not have health insurance; it must also
address those who are moments away from losing health insurance coverage because
an employer decides to reduce or eliminate coverage.

NDSU Offers Health Insurance Workbook

BYLINE: The Dickey County Leader staff

LENGTH: 277  words


The North D.kota State University Extension Service has a helpful Smart Choice
Health Insurance Workbook available to assist consumers as they make important
health insurance plan choices.


This also is the time that those people who were newly
insured in 2014 can renew their health plan coverage and subsidies.


An increasing number of North Dakotans are expected to enroll or renew policies
in health insurance plans during this open enrollment period.


"However, there are a few key dates consumers should be aware of when planning
their health insurance purchases for next year," Scharmer says.


Under the Affordable Care Act, uninsured individuals generally may enroll in
private, non group coverage Paris or change plans only during open enrollment.


Jan. 1, 2015, is the earliest coverage can begin for a plan bought during the
open enrollment period.


People with qualifying events, such as getting married or having a baby, can
enroll in a health insurance plan at any time.


Consumers may purchase a qualifying health insurance plan through the federal
marketplace at http://www.healthcare.gov' or through an insurance company or
agent.


That's because the fiscal 2012 municipal budget will largely be shaped by
whether City Manager Michael V. O'Brien is able to fully implement a plan he has
come up with to lower the city's budget-choking health insurance costs.


If he is unable to do so, he said, he will have no choice but to include 131
municipal employee layoffs in his fiscal 2012 budget proposal, which he plans on
presenting to the City Council in late April.


Even if the city's collective bargaining groups don't buy into the city
manager's health insurance plan at this time, it doesn't mean that the status
quo for health insurance will be maintained.


Municipal employees could very well
end up in a plan similar to what the manager has proposed not too far down the
road, only that plan would be administered by the state and there would be no
local control.


Deval L. Patrick's employee health care bill would require municipalities
and their unions to develop changes in their health insurance plans similar to
the state's health insurance pool administered by the Group Insurance
Commission.


Another bill before the Legislature, meanwhile, would grant cities and towns
universal authority to modify their health insurance plan designs, including
co-pays and deductibles.


Because he cannot afford to wait for the Legislature to act, Mr. O'Brien and his
administration have developed a new health insurance plan, in partnership with
local health care providers.


The new plan includes an innovative local health care network designed
specifically for city employees.


It incorporates provider discounts and an
improved medical management program that gives employees access to high-quality
health insurance providers.


Mr. O'Brien said the plan mirrors the state's GIC, but it maintains local
control.


He said the plan would include lower premiums for the city and
employees.


In turn, however, employees would have to pay deductibles and tiered
co-payments that are similar to those in GIC health plans and higher than what
they pay now.


Last week, Mr. O'Brien announced he is moving all municipal employees not
represented by a collective bargaining group into that new health plan,
effective July 1.


The movement of those 630 employees off traditional health
insurance plans to a GIC-like health plan is expected to save the non-school
side of the municipal government up to $500,000.


Mr. O'Brien said if all other city-side employees were to agree to move into
that plan it would reduce the city's fiscal 2012 deficit by $5 million.


City Manager O'Brien, meanwhile, said he has already had discussions about his
plan with the leadership of the city-side municipal unions and the Insurance
Advisory Committee, and is willing to discuss it further with them.


That's because the fiscal 2012 municipal
budget will largely be shaped by whether City Manager Michael V. O'Brien is able
to fully implement a plan he has come up with to lower the city's budget-choking
health insurance costs.


Act 10, the 2011 law that stripped most public employee unions of their
bargaining rights, required that teachers and other public union employees on
the state health insurance plan pay at least 12 percent of the costs.


Rates would increase between $7 and $9 monthly for the least expensive plan,
which covers the employee only.


Family plan rates would increase between $21 and $29 monthly for the most
expensive plan.


Two other plans, employee/spouse and employee/child or children, would increase
$13 and $24 a month, respectively.


The plan would cost the school district an estimated $10.6 million a year, or
about $389,800 more than this year's plans.


Rates would increase between $5 and $7 a month for the single employee plan and
between $16 and $24 a month for a family plan.


The employee/spouse and employee/child or children plan would increase $10 and
$17 a month, resepctively.


The plan would cost the district an estimated $10.63 million, or about $432,000
more than this year's plans.

Are health cash plans worth paying for?


Health cash plans aren't affected by the recent health insurance
changes - so the cost of these will be the same as before.


The first thing to understand is that health cash plans are not
health insurance.


Cash plans are not the solution if you want full cover for hospital bills,
access to private hospital services - or if you are worried about bypassing
public hospital queues.


Cash plans are, however, worth considering if you can't afford private health
insurance or if you're happy to rely on the public system for hospital
treatment.


You can buy cash plans from VHI Healthcare, Laya Healthcare and GloHealth - as
well as the specialist provider, HSF Health Plan.


This plan also gives you (EURO)80 for every night spent in hospital up to 40
nights per person, per year.


So, if you're looking to cover the (EURO)75 public
hospital charge in addition to all the other benefits, this plan potentially
ticks the box.


Like any insurance product, there are pitfalls with cash plans.


However, if you
are cancelling your health insurance and you transfer to a HSF health plan, you
will be covered immediately.


Like any insurance
product, examine the terms and conditions of the plan and check everything in
advance of any treatment.


Given that 300,000 people have left private health insurance, health cash plans
have become more popular.


With cash plans, you should be able to access primary care services and get an
early diagnosis rather than waiting months for an appointment while you worry or
suffer in the interim.


The really
smart consumers are integrating mid-level health insurance with a quality health
cash plan to give themselves the best overall cover without overspending.


It is estimated that about 25 million Americans will be eligible to purchase
health insurance from a Marketplace and as many as 20 million of those are
expected, based on their income, to qualify for a federal subsidy to help them
and their family purchase their health insurance through a Marketplace.


Not all health plans available for individuals to purchase today will be
available beyond 2013 or for purchase through Marketplaces.


In some cases, these
plans will be terminated because they do not meet the minimum standards of
health insurance coverage that will be applied to health plans beginning in
2014.


Beginning in 2014, individuals may elect to purchase private health insurance
outside of a Marketplace; however, the available information about plans and
prices from California's Marketplace (Covered California) suggests that most
individual consumers of health insurance will be able to save money by
purchasing it through the Marketplace.


First, consumers purchasing a health plan through a Marketplace are given
assurances that these plans meet basic standards for quality, consumer
protections and provider availability.


By providing information about the plans' quality, benefits,
providers, premiums, co-payments and deductibles in a side-by-side manner using
simple terms, Marketplaces can help consumers to make the sorts of choices they
make when shopping for other products.


Finally, individuals eligible to purchase health insurance through a Marketplace
are guaranteed the opportunity to purchase the plan they choose - plans cannot
refuse to provide coverage based on an individual's pre-existing condition.

Older people overpaying (EURO)1,000 on health plans;
Expert says policyholders must review premiums for better deal

BYLINE: Christian McCashin

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.


According to Dermot Goode, a leading health insurance consultant many older
policy holders don't review their plans each year and risk being on an
overpriced plan for what their actual needs and requirements are.


'The issue here is that for one reason or another people are staying on the same
plan for too long.'


'When it comes to health insurance, people should review
their plan every year just as they would home or car insurance.


Mr Goode said that many older people in Ireland are on dated plans that have
been on the market for as long as 10 to 25 years, which means they are very
expensive.


÷Older people are more likely to be unaware of the availability of corporate
plans ÷When asked about changing, the majority of older members are unaware that
the legislation protects them fully in terms of not having to re-serve waiting
periods and continuity of cover for equivalent benefits.


And many younger people are still opting for the cheaper entry level plans which
don't offer fully comprehensive cover or health insurance plans that best suits
their needs.


'Older
people are more comfortable remaining with the same provider and/or plan because
it's a case of ''better the devil you know''.


The myriad of terms and conditions
that accompany plans, coupled with the fact that there are literally hundreds of
plans on the market, just serve to compound the challenge for them.'


He added
that comparing and selecting a new and better value plan 'can be a daunting
task.'


'Trying to understand the various plans and many people simply don't have
the confidence to make a change - even if it will save them serious money.'

County considers new insurance plan for employees

BYLINE: Amanda Seitz, Hamilton JournalNews, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 458 words


Aug. 29--BUTLER COUNTY -- Officials here are looking to offer employees
different health insurance plan options next year to drive down rising costs and
save money for taxpayers.


To offset rising health insurance costs, county commissioners Thursday
considered a new, $2,500 high-deductible plan for employees to select.


The plan
would still drive up costs by about $210,000 for the county and pass on a
collective $777,000 in cost increases to employees.


The county has tried to shop for a new health insurance provider in hopes of
lowering its costs, but five major health insurance companies have either
declined to be a provider or offered up services at a 30 percent to 35 percent
rate increase.


The Hamilton JournalNews/Middletown Journal first reported last week that a
county employee had filed a record-breaking $5 million health insurance claim
within the last year through the county's provider, the County Employee Benefits
Consortium of Ohio.


Introducing a high-deductible plan for county employees to select would lower
health insurance costs and give employees more out-of-pocket costs in favor of a
lower month premium.


Employees would still have access to low-deductible plans
for a higher cost under the plan commissioners are considering.


Ryan said the high-deductible plan would likely attract younger, single workers
who don't have high medical bills.


"The high deductible, low cost plan, could benefit our employees here,"
Commissioner Cindy Carpenter said.


The county is also considering a few additional charges for employees to
generate revenue to pay for the plans in 2014 or 2015.


Commissioners could select to charge an extra $50 for smokers who are on the
health insurance plan.


A $100 monthly charge for spouses who join the county
health insurance plan is also an option commissioners are considering for this
year or next.


Commissioners must finalize the health plan options for 2014 by Oct. 4.

City health center helps residents enroll in state health insurance exchange

BYLINE: Johanna Somers, The Day, New London, Conn.


She said wanted to know what health insurance plan she would
qualify for based on her net weekly salary of $240.


If someone without health insurance doesn't sign up
by March 31, he or she will be charged a penalty of 1 percent of his or her
annual income or $95, whichever is greater for the first year.


Access Health CT, the quasi-public state agency assigned with setting up the
marketplace under the federal Affordable Care Act, offers plans at the bronze,
silver and gold levels by three providers: Anthem, ConnectiCare and HealthyCT.


The bronze level is considered the cheapest because it has the lowest monthly
premium.


But the bronze plan also has the highest annual deductible.


A person
who is healthy and doesn't plan on going to the hospital might choose the bronze
plan, said Stefan Kostolitz, outreach and eligibility associate for the
Community Health Center.


The gold plan has the highest monthly premium but a low deductible, and the
silver plan lies in the middle.


The silver and gold plans have been the most popular, said Marie Yardis, manager
of access to care for Community Health Center.


Emma, 52, who had brought her mother to the center Saturday for a checkup, said
she wanted to only research the plan because her new job might provide her with
health insurance.


Based on the data she entered into www.AccessHealthCT.com, her
monthly premium would be $72 to $120 depending, on which provider she chose.


"I learned about the plan, and I think I like it, but I have to go and check my
job and make the decision," Emma said.


Based on the website's calculations, she said her health insurance premium would
be $300 a month under the gold plan instead of $589 a month under the Charter
Oak Health Plan offered to low-income adults in Connecticut.


Broadly, there are four types of medical and health insurance plans in
Malaysia.


They are group health insurance; hospitalisation benefit plan; hospital
and surgical plan; and critical illness plan.


Some plans
cover employees' immediate family as well.


Hospitalisation benefit plans pay policyholders a fixed amount on a per
night basis for the duration of their stay in the hospital regardless of
what the hospital bill comes up to.


Furthermore, the plan pays the amount even if you already have other
form of health insurance plans.


Those who are covered by their employers' group health insurance may
consider hospitalisation benefit plans.


Hospital and surgical plans pay the entire hospital and surgical bills.


Such plans are suitable for those who do not have any form of group
health and medical insurance.


Bear in mind, however, you can't claim on another hospital and surgical
insurance plan if you already claimed on another similar plan.


A critical illness plan pays the policyholder a lump sum upon the
diagnosis of any of the critical illnesses covered or in the even of an
accident.


This plan is popular as more people become aware of the common major
diseases such as various cancers and heart diseases.


How do you know which plan is most suitable for you?


Although you may already be covered by your company's benefits plan, or are
considering the Medishield Plus, the question remains: Is your coverage enough
and will you need more?


Your needs

What are the various types of health insurance plans and how much do you need?


If your main concern is coping with the medical bills of short-term
hospitalisation and surgery, and that the general level of medical benefits
provided by your employer is insufficient, then you could consider "topping up"
your medical benefits with either a hospital and surgical plan, or a hospital
daily cash plan.


However, if the thought of a serious illness requiring prolonged medical
treatment is your worry, then you should consider a catastrophic medical plan or
a living assurance plan.


Hospital and surgical plan

With the basic hospital and surgical (HAS) plan, the health insurance company
reimburses expenses for surgery and hospitalisation charges such as daily ward
charges, consultation fees, X-ray and other diagnostic test fees and
post-hospitalisation treatment.


Should you have more than one health
insurance plan, for example, Medishield or a private plan from another company,
your claims from all the sources cannot exceed the total expenses incurred.


Basically, if you decide to buy a HAS plan, find one with benefits and limits
that combine with your company's benefits scheme to provide adequate coverage,
keeping in mind that higher benefits limits would require higher premiums.


Hospital daily cash benefit plan

With the hospital daily cash benefit (HB) plan, fixed cash benefit is provided
for each day of stay in the hospital, regardless of your actual medical
expenses.


The advantages of HB plans are that they are easy to understand and the claim
proceeds can be used to help cover incidental expenses such as travel and
accommodation, which a HAS plan will not reimburse.


Catastrophic medical plan

A catastrophic medical insurance plan (CMI) reimburses all or part of your
expenses in excess of the first $ X, called the deductible.


In the event of a claim, the deductible is the minimum amount you have to pay
before the insurance company will make any benefit payments to you.


Living assurance

The living assurance plan, on the other hand, is designed to give you financial
protection should any common major illness occur.


These usually include heart attack, coronary heart
by-pass, cancer, kidney failure, major organ transplant, stroke, et cetera.


Under such a plan, a fixed lump sum is paid upon diagnosis of a major illness.


Should you not suffer any illness, the plan still works like a whole life
insurance policy, covering you for as long as you live.


Premiums

Most health insurance plans are renewable every year, with the premiums
increasing with age.


For living assurance plans, premiums are fixed at the time
you take up the policy and they remain constant throughout the premium-paying
period of the insurance period.


Medishield vs Private Health Insurance Plans

Medishield/Medishield Plus <> Lower premiums <> Premiums can be paid through
MediSave <> There is a deductible/co-insurance * <> Coverage up to 70 years old

* Deductible in the amount of expenses that the patient must bear before he
becomes eligible for benefit payment under the insurance * Co-insurance means
that the insured pay a specified percentage of all the eligible medical expenses
(in excess of a deductible, if any).


Private Health Insurance Plans ** <> Relatively higher premiums <> Premiums must
be paid in cash <> No deductible/co-insurance under most plans <> Coverage for
up to 75 years under some plans

* Plans vary from company to company

Example 1

How Medishield Works Total medical costs incurred ...  $ 10,000 Deductible (B
class ward) ...  $ 4,000 Remaining amount to be paid ...  $ 6,000

Co-insurance feature You pay 20% of $ 6,000 = $ 1,200 Medishield pays 80% of $
6,000 = $ 4,800 You pay a total of $ 5,200 ($ 4,000 + $ 1,200) and Medishield
pays $ 4,800.

If you're planning on not buying health insurance this year to save some money,
know this:

It's gonna cost you, anyway.


Variously known as the "penalty," "fine" or " individual mandate," the fee for
not having health insurance in 2016 is calculated in two ways - as a percentage
of household income, or per person, according to healthcare.gov.


In 2016, the percentage of household income you pay is 2.5%.


The maximum amount
is calculated as the total yearly premium for the national average price of a
bronze plan sold through the Marketplace.


With this method, only the part of household income above the yearly tax filing
threshold is counted - $10,150 for individuals, or $20,300 for couples filing
jointly in 2014, the most recent year available.


Low-income households or people who don't pay the fee because they're unemployed
may qualify for an exemption.


SIDEBAR:

People covered under the following plans won't have to pay a penalty for not
having health insurance this year, according to healthcare.gov:

*Any health plan bought through the Health Insurance Marketplace-

*Individual health plans bought outside the Health Insurance Marketplace that
meet the standards for qualified plans-

*Any "grandfathered" individual insurance plan obtained since March 23, 2010 or
earlier-

*Any job-based plan, including retiree plans and COBRA coverage-

*Medicare Part A or Part C (Part B coverage by itself doesn't qualify)-

*Most Medicaid coverage, except for limited coverage plans-

*The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)-

*Coverage under a parent's plan-

*Most student health plans, though students are advised to check with their
school to see if the plan counts as minimum essential coverage.


New plans are expected to emerge in the first few months of
this year, ahead of the new rules coming into force.


This has given rise to plans which provide cover in a
restricted network of hospitals, and plans that require consumers to make hefty
co-payments for certain types of procedure.


Figures are based on the Health Insurance Authority's (HIA) online
comparison of health insurance plans.


**1 The family plan**

Alan and his wife Michelle are in their 30s, with two young children.


They want
cover for a semi-private room in a private hospital, with no inpatient excess.


-- A total of 17 plans matched the couple's needs, with a difference of about
EUR 1,000 between the annual cost per adult of the dearest and cheapest plans.


He wants top-of-the-range
cover for health insurance plans, based on a private room in a high-tech
hospital.


-- Fifteen health insurance plans match his criteria, with prices varying by
more than EUR 3,000 annually.


She would like a
health insurance plan that provides cover for a semi-private or private room in
a public hospital.


If Aoife decides that she'd like a plan with basic hospital
cover, plus a low outpatient excess and day-to-day benefits, the cost will rise.


*For more, see the HIA's website, hia.ie*

**The figures**

**2.018m:**the number of people with inpatient health insurance

**100,000:**the number of people insured on health insurance cash plans or
products that provide only outpatient benefits

**43.8%:**percentage of the population with health insurance

                          The Lebanon Democrat, Tenn.


The law, which President Barack Obama signed into effect in 2010, requires
Americans to be covered under a health insurance plan by February.


Nearly 10 million
uninsured individuals enrolled in a marketplace plan during the first enrollment
wave, but 30 million remain uninsured.


PharmaCare will provide a free Medicare consultation with a pharmacist to help
seniors pick the best prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan based on
their current list of medications.


The open enrollment period for choosing a
Medicare plan is currently ongoing and will end Sunday.


Lucas mentioned one of the things people are surprised about is that plans now
have no-cost preventive care services.


All insurance plans through the
marketplace must cover these services without copays or co-insurance, according
to literature available at the library's assistance center.


Tips for bridging the gap

Enroll in the working spouse's group plan: This is probably the most common and
least expensive way for a retired spouse to obtain health insurance.


Buy a state-sponsored guaranteed health insurance plan: These are called
HIPAA-eligible plans or high-risk pools, depending on the program the state
offers.


By 2014, uninsured retirees
who make too much to qualify for subsidized health plans will be able to buy
coverage, regardless of health, through private insurers via a state-sponsored
insurance exchange.


Start a small business or work part-time: Some states require insurers to offer
group plans to the self-employed.


Small group plans are usually more
cost-effective and offer better benefits than most individual health insurance
contracts.


Buy an individual insurance plan: Because premiums frequently increase along
with age and health complications, insurance purchased from a private insurer is
the retiree's most expensive option, if he or she can qualify at all.


But
individual plans often do not provide the comprehensive coverage the retiree is
accustomed to.


High-deductible plans combined with a Health Savings Account are becoming an
increasingly popular solution.


These plans usually have a $5,000 to $10,000
deductible with a limit on out-of-pocket costs.


Read the fine print and
understand what expenses meet the deductible.


Some plans consider only "normal
and customary" expenses.


Any excess out-of-pocket expense will not be credited
toward the deductible.


With proper planning, the ability to retire early may be more than just a dream.


No offers may be made
or accepted from any resident outside these states due to various state
requirements and registration requirements regarding investment products and
services.


It''s no surprise then that a survey published last week found that one-third of
young families plan to cancel their private health insurance this year.


If you''re struggling to make ends meet but are reluctant to cut out your
private health insurance, moving to a cheaper plan could be an option.


The Sunday Independent lined up private health insurance expert Aongus Loughlin
of Towers Watson to recommend plans which might just allow you to hold onto your
insurance in these tough times.


You want a cheaper plan which, at the very least,
offers good cover for treatment in a public hospital.


If you switch to Laya Healthcare''s Essential First plan, you could almost halve
the cost of your cover.


This plan, which costs (EURO)504.40 is one of the
cheapest plans around, according to Loughlin.


This plan provides full cover for a
semi-private room in public hospitals.


Another plan tipped by Loughlin is Glo Health''s Basic plan.


Although you both work, the cutbacks and tax hikes of the last few years have
made it hard for you to make ends meet - so unless you get a cheaper private
health insurance plan, you''ll have to give it up.


This plan,
the cheapest recommended by Loughlin for the family, costs (EURO)842.50 per
adult and (EURO)206.54 per child over the age of three.


As children under the age of three are free under Glo''s Better Plan, the total
cost of your plan comes to (EURO)1,891.50 for the year.


Another plan that is recommended by Loughlin is Laya''s Total Health Choice
plan, which costs (EURO)2,295 for the family - or (EURO)2,364 if paying monthly.


One of the cheapest VHI plans is its PMI 2612 corporate plan, which costs
(EURO)2,533 this year for two adults and two children.


The cheapest Aviva plan
recommended by Loughlin is Health Plan 05, which costs (EURO)2,561.20 for the
family.


"These plans provide cover for private rooms in public hospitals, as well as
cover for a semi-private room in a private hospital," said Loughlin.


The excess on these plans (the first part of the claim which you must pay
yourself) for treatment in a private hospital varies, depending on the insurer
you're with.


If you''re likely to require cover for hip replacements or eye surgery
operations, check the excess on a plan before you move as it can be as high as
(EURO)2,000 in some cases, warned Loughlin.


However you''d like to hold onto a plan that covers your family for a
semiprivate room in hospital.


You could save between (EURO)983 and (EURO)1,484
this year by opting for one of the plans recommended by Loughlin.


At a total
cost of (EURO)2,516.50, the cheapest plan tipped by Loughlin is Glo Health''s
Better Plan.


The second cheapest is Laya''s Total Health Choice plan, which
costs (EURO)2,569 a year - or (EURO)2,646 if you pay monthly.


If the family go for VHI or Aviva plans recommended by Loughlin, they''ll pay a
few hundred euro more than they will at Glo or Laya - VHI''s PMI 2612 costs
(EURO)2,866.70 while Aviva''s Health Plan 05 costs (EURO)3,017.


All these plans include cover for a semi-private room in a private hospital.


Again, it''s important to check out any excesses that apply before choosing one
of these plans.


At this stage in your lives, you want a plan that offers good hospital care.


You could easily halve the cost of your private health insurance by choosing one
of the plans tipped by Loughlin.


The cheapest plan recommended by Loughlin is Laya''s Healthcare Healthwise Plus
(No Excess), which costs the couple (EURO)1,770 a year - or (EURO)1,823 if
paying monthly.


Other plans recommended by Loughlin are Aviva''s Level 2 Complete Health plan,
which costs the couple (EURO)3,527.20; Glo Health''s Ultra Plan, which costs
(EURO)3,596; and VHI''s Health Plus Extra (Plan B Options), which costs
(EURO)3,674.


These plans offer semi-private care in a private hospital.


"The plans also provide cover for certain cardiac procedures if carried out in
the Mater Private or Blackrock Clinics," said Loughlin.


CASH PLANS If your financial circumstances mean you have no option but to go
without private health insurance, a health cash plan could be an option.


These
plans cover day-today medical costs, such as GP, dental and consultant fees -
rather than hospital care.


The cost of HSF Health Plan for example - a cash plan offered by the Hospital
Saturday Fund - ranges from (EURO)114 to (EURO)972 a year.

GoHealth Encourages Health Insurance Enrollment Before December Deadline

LENGTH: 383  words


Dec. 8 -- US-based GoHealthInsurance issued the following news release:

GoHealth, the nation's leading private health insurance exchange, urges
consumers to explore their health insurance options and enroll before December
15.


Selecting a health insurance plan prior to December 15 allows people to
secure health benefits for January 1 and prevents them from being automatically
re-enrolled in an old plan with outdated subsidies.


Seventy seven new insurers are offering Marketplace plans and some plans from
last year have been modified for the new year.


Because there are more insurance
plans available and different prices for 2015 coverage, GoHealth encourages
consumers to explore their choices now.


"With so many new options on the Marketplace, the health insurance plan you
selected last year may no longer be your best choice.


This is your opportunity
to determine if your current plan meets your needs or if it's time to rightsize
your health plan," says Clint Jones, CEO of GoHealth.


Consumers must enroll in a health plan and pay their first month's premium by
December 15 in order for their health insurance to take effect on January 1.


People who currently have insurance and do not take action before December 15
will be automatically re-enrolled in the health plan that is most similar to
their current plan using their tax subsidy amount that was calculated last year.


That may result in consumers missing out on significant monthly savings and
plans that better meet their needs.


"With pricing changes, new plans available, and potential changes in the subsidy
amount, it is in your best interest to spend a couple minutes on
GoHealthInsurance.com to see what your best option is," says Brandon Cruz,
President of GoHealth.


By choosing to actively enroll with GoHealth, consumers can get their new,
accurate tax subsidies and compare all of the current Marketplace plans.


Shoppers can speak with a licensed insurance advisor to get updated tax
subsidies and step-by-step assistance enrolling in coverage, or they can visit
(GoHealthInsurance.com) to compare thousands of health plans from top carriers,
including those that have updated their plans or are new to the Marketplace.

eHealth Highlights Average Premiums, Deductibles for Obamacare Shoppers Not
Using Subsidies During 2016 Open Enrollment Period

LENGTH: 595  words


Oct. 20 -- eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) reported today that consumers shopping
for 2016 health insurance plans and not utilizing premium tax credits (often
referred to as Obamacare subsidies) chose health insurance plans with monthly
premiums averaging $321 for individuals and $833 for families.


eHealth's findings are derived from an analysis of plans selected by more than
70,000 individual and family health insurance shoppers at eHealth.com during the
2016 open enrollment period (November 1, 2015 - January 31, 2016).


Highlights
include the following:

* Monthly premiums averaged $321 for individuals and $833 for families

* Annual deductibles averaged $4,358 for individuals and $7,983 for families

* The average individual platinum plan ($498 per month) cost 58% more than the
average bronze plan ($315 per month)

* Bronze-level plans accounted for 44% of all individual and family plans
selected; silver: 29%; gold: 12%; platinum: 3%; and catastrophic: 12%

* HMO-style plans accounted for 40% of all individual and family plans selected;
PPO: 38%; EPO: 16%; and POS: 6%

* Nearly 40% of eHealth shoppers identified themselves as previously
uninsured[1]

"eHealth has been tracking cost and selection trends in the individual and
family health insurance market for years," said the Honorable Ellen Tauscher,
Chairman of the Board for eHealth, Inc. "We're excited to continue serving the
needs of America's health insurance consumers and believe that public/private
partnerships can deliver the benefits of the Affordable Care Act to even more
Americans in the years to come."


It does not offer a comprehensive view of costs for all
plans available through eHealth, through the market as a whole, or through
government exchanges.


Specific health
insurance plan premiums, deductibles, and other features may differ
significantly from any averages or other presented statistics.

Premiums increase as insurance companies prepare for new customers

BYLINE: Brandi Jewett, Grand Forks Herald

SECTION: LIFESTYLE

LENGTH: 1355 words


Oct. 30--Health insurance providers in North Dakota are slimming down some of
their plan offerings to meet state benchmarks, but the cost of insurance doesn't
seem to be decreasing for everyone with the reduction in options.


Blue Cross Blue Shield and Medica are reducing their offerings of insurance
plans, but raising premiums to cover costs associated with changes established
by the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare.


Changes brought by the Affordable Care Act include a state benchmark plan with
minimal coverage requirements and a mandate that no one in the United States can
be turned down for health insurance.


The adjustments to plans and benefits are part of the two companies' efforts to
meet that state benchmark, which was chosen by the state Department of Insurance
and is sold by competitor Sanford Health.


"That plan does not offer as many benefits as most BCBSND plans," Dinneen said.


"But in order to remain as affordable as other metallic plans offered on the
health insurance marketplace, BCBSND adopted the same level of benefits as the
benchmark plan for those products."


The term "metallic" refers to the bronze, silver and gold plan standards set by
the Affordable Care Act.


Rising premiums

It seems many of the plan adjustments result in higher prices and fewer plan
options to choose from for customers.


The estimated cost of the least expensive insurance plan under Medica this year
for a nonsmoking 30-year-old male or female buying individual coverage in Grand
Forks was $70 per month.


Blue Cross's least expensive plan jumps from $47 per month to $179.


The Herald requested similar insurance plan price quotes for 2013 and 2014 from
Sanford Health, but the request was not met by deadline.


This year, a family of four searching for the lowest monthly health insurance
price in 2013 could have selected an estimated $307 per month plan from Medica
or a $569 plan from Blue Cross Blue Shield.


For the most part, plan prices are increasing but the number of options
customers have to choose from is shrinking.


In 2013, the number of plans available to that 30-year-old nonsmoking male or
female was 31 under Blue Cross.


Starting Jan. 1, that number drops to 15 plans.


The list of 10 services includes
outpatient care, inpatient care, emergency care, mental health services,
laboratory services and pediatric care.


Dinneen said the company is concerned about the "implications of the benchmark
plan chosen for members who have been accustomed to more covered services in
their health insurance."


While cuts are taking place, companies are also adding benefits to plans.


One addition Medica is making to its plans is increased prescription drug
coverage, which was not covered beyond a certain tier prior to 2014.


After Jan.
1, all prescriptions are covered 100 percent after the deductible is paid.


Prenatal and maternity care, once not included in plans, also is now
incorporated in Medica's metallic plans.


Root of increases

The price increases of the insurance plan come with a few explanations.


The company stated adjusting plans to meet requirements of the reform law and
the health status of customers also could affect next year's premium prices.


Dinneen didn't provide details about the why Blue Cross plan costs would
increase.


She did say the company "is committed to continue to work with providers to be
able to provide the right care, at the right time and at the right cost for our
members."


Those penalties are 1 percent of taxable
income or $95 per adult and $47.50 per child -- whichever is greater.


A maximum of $285 has been set per family, a seemly small price compared to
$6,700 to $8,000 a year for a health insurance plan.


Exchange history

So far, North Dakota's state government has had almost no involvement with the
health insurance exchange following the approval of its benchmark plan.


The Sanford Heath plan was recommended by the state Insurance Department and the
state Legislative Health Care Reform Review Committee after they reviewed an
independent analysis completed on benchmark choices and public comments.


The state's three main health insurance providers, Blue Cross, Sanford and
Medica, all submitted plans for consideration.


The selected plan from Sanford was sent to and approved by the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.


The usual scenario however, includes an employer providing his employees and
their dependents (spouse and children under 18) with a valid health insurance
plan.


Individuals and small companies who are not eligible for a basic health
insurance plan must undergo a process of underwriting and medical evaluation
prior to the issuance of their insurance policies.


Certain factors such as deductibles, medical condition, age, gender, selection
of a plan, marital status, weight and pre-existing conditions are put into
consideration once an individual applies for a health insurance plan.


A plan with an international territory, for example, will
have a higher premium as well as a member with a pre-existing diseases or high
plan benefits," said Michael Bitzer, chief executive officer for the National
Health Insurance Company (Daman), partners with the Health Authority Abu Dhabi
(HAAD).


The health insurance scheme offers three kinds of policies for coverage:

Basic Health Insurance Policy - for individuals with monthly salaries less than
Dh5,000 or Dh4,000 plus housing allowance.

According to the
Department of Health and Human Services, without subsidies, the average premium
of a 2016 Obamacare plan purchased on HealthCare.gov was $396 a month per
person.


In comparison, the average monthly premium for a term health insurance
plan selected on AgileHealthInsurance.com is less than $100 per person.


Without a qualifying life
event, consumers will not be able to enroll in an Affordable Care Act (ACA) plan
until the 2017 open enrollment period begins Nov. 1, and that coverage will not
become active until Jan. 1 of the following year.


Term health insurance represents a distinct category of health insurance that is
generally more affordable than Obamacare plans.


Eligibility requirements and
flexibility in benefits are major factors contributing to the cost savings
realized by consumers.


Unlike Obamacare plans, term health insurance
applications are approved or rejected based on health status, including the
nature of pre-existing conditions.


Consumers can compare term health plans from various insurers at
AgileHealthInsurance.com, including HCC Life Insurance Co., Unified Life
Insurance Co., Companion Life Insurance Co. and Standard Life.


Agile customers
can also enroll in Foundation dental and vision plans underwritten by
Nationwide.


Although that change would reduce city health insurance costs, he said, the Blue
Cross proposal would remain more expensive than the Fallon plan because Blue
Cross did not make an assumption for mid-year rate increases on its senior
plans.


''I continue to recommend that the city go forward with replacing our Blue Cross
products with Fallon products, so that Fallon Community Health Plan becomes the
sole provider of health insurance for all city of Worcester employees and
retirees,'' Mr. Hoover said.


Under state law, the city is required to pay at least 50 percent of the cost of
an indemnity plan, and the employee is required to pay at least 10 percent of a
managed care plan.


As a result of contract negotiations over the years, the city
pays 75 percent to 90 percent of the health insurance costs, depending upon the
plan.


But based on the rate increases proposed by Blue Cross and Fallon, the city's
health insurance costs would increase by $11.1 million next year, if the same
plans and contributions rates remained in effect.


After Mr. Hoover announced the city's plans to drop Blue Cross as a provider of
health insurance and make Fallon the sole insurer, Blue Cross submitted its
counterproposal on Tuesday.


It would like to scale back the city's contribution rate
for the indemnity plan from 75 percent to 70 percent, and reduce its
contribution rate for HMO and POS plans from 90 percent and 87 percent,
respectively, to 80 percent.


The filings do not
include premium for plans negotiated with large employers.


A total of 1,377 plans were submitted for review, including 1,221 medical plans

Health Colorado, the state's health insurance exchange.


The exchange medical
plans consist of 239 individual plans and 186 small group plans.


Overall, 23 carriers seek to offer individual and/ or small group medical plans
in 2016.


Of those, 11 seek to offer plans through Connect for Health Colorado.


"As in 2014 and 2015, it is great to see so many carriers offering plans in
Colorado," Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar said in a

statement.


When open enrollment comes this fall, folks should shop and carefully
consider the plans that are best for their needs."


When you fill out the Marketplace application, you'll find out if you
qualify for a private health insurance plan and whether you qualify for lower
costs based on your household size and income.


You'll have the opportunity
to compare private plans side-by-side and choose the one that fits your family
and budget.


They include:

Pay your premium to your health insurance plan by the due date.


Carefully review your member card and other materials your plan sends you.

Contact your plan with any questions or if you don't get a member card and
enrollment materials.


All of the Marketplace plans cover a comprehensive set of Essential Health
Benefits.


Insurance plans will no longer be able to charge you more or refuse to provide
coverage for you or your family if you have a pre-existing condition.


Only plans offered in the Marketplace offer lower costs based on income.


With that same application, you'll find out if you are
eligible for lower costs on your premiums or out-of-pocket costs based on
income.

Open enrollment here for health plans

BYLINE: Charles Joffe-Halpern

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 739 words


NORTH ADAMS &GT;&GT;

We are entering a critically important time in Massachusetts for health reform,
as we begin the annual health insurance open enrollment period starting Saturday
and lasting until Feb. 15.


All of these plans are going to end within the next three months
and all individuals enrolled in these plans will have to re-apply for health
insurance to insure they have no gaps in coverage.


All individuals enrolled in these plans too, will have to re-apply for
health insurance.


All individuals enrolled in the above plans should be closely watching their
mail for notifications of when their insurance plans will end and about
timelines for re-applying for health insurance.


As the above health insurance plans are ending, it is important for Berkshire
County residents to understand the health insurance plans for which they may now
be eligible.


The new plans include the following:

Qualified Health Plans are health plans that offer all required benefits
specified under national health reform.


Individuals
with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, $46,680 a
year, or $95,400 for a family of four may also be eligible for advanced premium
tax credits, which is money that the federal government pays directly to
insurance companies every month so that individuals have lower monthly premiums
this will significantly reduce the cost health insurance.


ConnectorCare plans are qualified health insurance plans for individuals and
families with incomes up to 300 percent of the fpl, $35,010, or $71,550 of a
family of four.


In addition to premium tax credits, individuals and families
will also receive help paying out-of-pocket costs, such as co-pays and
deductibles.


Qualification for the above programs is contingent on individuals not qualifying
for health insurance that is considered minimal essential coverage, such as
coverage under a government-sponsored program, or an employer sponsored plan.


If
they qualify for coverage through an employer, they may still qualify for health
coverage, if an individual's share of the premium for an individual health plan
is more than 9.5 percent of their family's income, or if the plan offered by the
employer covers less than 60 percent of the health care costs.


MassHealth CarePlus is a MassHealth coverage type for adult citizens and
qualifying noncitizens under age 65 with incomes no greater than 133 percent of
the federal poverty level.


The MassHealth qualification rules use a 133 percent
fpl income limit and a 5 percent income disregard.


In effect, this makes the
income limit to 138 percent of the fpl ($16,112 for an individual).


Many families are questioning whether they can still afford health insurance,
and research published earlier this year by insurer Laya revealed that one in
three customers with children were planning to cancel their cover this year.


In a bid to stem the flow of departing customers, insurers have launched a range
of new plans and offers aimed at families who need more affordable cover.


For example, VHI Healthcare is offering half-price cover for children on a
number of its plans, including One Plan Family, Parent & Kids Excess Plan,
Teacher Plan Select and Nurses Plan Select.


Aviva is running a special offer for children on its Family Focus plan.


For families,
Glo's ongoing kids offer is attractive, with children under three getting free
cover on the insurers Better, Best, Ultra and Ultimate plans.


Aside from the recent batch of offers for families, Dermot Goode of
healthinsurancesa vings.ie said consumers also needed to be aware of the move by
insurers to offer more affordable plans, but with more limited cover.


"These new
plans no longer cover all hospitals," Goode said.


Aviva's new range of Focus plans is an example of this approach.


"Because they
provide cover for a selected list of hospitals and exclude some benefits, they
cost less than our standard plans.


Laya Healthcare is today launching two new plans, Essential Value and Essential
Value 500.


"Insurers are trying to bring out plans with limited, reduced cover," he said.


However, Goode said that such plans came with "big health warnings" due to the
restricted cover available.


..........................

**What's the cheapest plan on offer at the moment?


**Glo:**Basic plan, EUR 560, covers a semi private room in a public hospital or
60 per cent of the rate for a semi private room in a private hospital

**Aviva:**Value Focus, EUR 525, full cover for day cases and inpatient stays in
a private room in selected public hospitals.


**1**When choosing your health insurance cover, remember that you can choose
different types of cover for different members of your family depending on their
requirements.


**5**Corporate plans offered to specific companies or large groups can sometimes
represent better value than the more common plans marketed by health insurers.


Consumers can choose to purchase these types of plan, as health insurers are
legally obliged to sell the same products to everyone.


**9**Assess the market properly before you switch to an alternative product or
provider.


If you do choose a cheaper plan, establish exactly what cover you are
losing.


The Health Insurance Authority's website (hia.ie) has a tool to make it
easier to pick a plan that is the best fit for you and your family, and allows
you to compare the benefits and cover on different plans.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City Announces Details of Plans to be
Available on the Health Insurance Marketplace

LENGTH: 1311  words


New Delhi, Sept. 26 -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City (Blue KC) today
announced details of the Blue KC health insurance plans they are offering on the
Health Insurance Marketplace, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).


"Consistent with our mission and long-standing commitment to the community,
these new plans build on our goal to offer a broad range of health care coverage
options that fit the needs of individuals and families who call Kansas City
their home," said David Gentile, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blue
KC.


The ACA mandates that all individual plans must provide coverage at designated
"metal" levels.


The defined metal, or coverage, levels are platinum, gold,
silver and bronze.


While monthly premiums are higher for a platinum plan,
subscribers will pay less when they use the plan in the form of deductibles,
coinsurance and copays.


Conversely, the bronze plan monthly premiums will be
lower, but deductibles, coinsurance and copays will be higher.


Blue KC networks include Preferred-Care Blue which offers Blue KC members the
largest selection of providers within our 32-county area, and Blue Select, a new
more limited provider network, available in Clay, Jackson and Platte counties in
Missouri and Johnson and Wyandotte counties in Kansas.


"Blue & U
First" provides 100 percent in-network coverage after deductible, and the first
four office visits come with no out-of-pocket cost to the member.


As in all plans,
it includes coverage for preventive care prior to deductible but tends to have a
lower deductible that must be met before other benefits are paid.


"Blue & U
Classic" is an insurance plan designed for individuals and families that want
cost certainty through copays when they need commonly-used services along with
coverage for unexpected accidents or illness.


While Blue KC plans will still be available for purchase directly, they will
also be available through the new Health Insurance Marketplace.


Health insurance brokers and agents are experts
on helping individuals find plans that best fit their needs and budgets.


Because of the complex nature of the health insurance industry and the wide
variety of benefits, networks, copays and deductibles available, it is important
to do thorough research to help select the right plan.

Medical reform debate at impasse

LENGTH: 637 words

HIGHLIGHT:
LDP committee opposes reliance on young workers to subsidize senior citizens


The government's plan to enact sweeping reforms of the nation's medical system
is in doubt because politicians and welfare officials are sharply divided over
overhauling medical insurance for the elderly, the centerpiece of the proposed
changes.


At odds are the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Research Commission on
Fundamental Policies for Medical Care, which recently proposed setting up an
independent insurance plan for senior citizens, and the Ministry of Health,
Labor and Welfare, which favors a system under which insurance contributions by
younger people subsidize senior citizens' medical expenses.


Some ministry officials,
however, say there is not enough time to deliberate the two plans.


Under
this plan, senior citizens paid some 1 trillion yen out of pocket in fiscal
2001, out of a total 11 trillion yen in costs for medical care for seniors.


Tough pill to swallow

Yuya Niwa, chairman of the LDP's Research Commission on Fundamental Policies for
Medical Care, said on Nov. 28 that elderly people would have to shoulder more of
the burden of their medical expenses under the independent medical insurance
plan that the party favors.


Under the plan, premiums for each health insurance union member would fall by
3,000 yen a year, while National Health Insurance members, many of whom are
senior citizens, would pay an additional 20,000 yen a year, according to the
Welfare Ministry.


The Welfare Ministry plans to formally release its proposal on revising the
medical care system this month.


Under the ministry's plan, health insurance unions with proportionately more
young members would continue to provide financial assistance to the National
Health Insurance plan, and National Health Insurance premiums would remain
unchanged.


Patients aged 70 and older started
paying 10% of their medical bills in October, while those with a substantial
income pay 20%.


8--County employees may save money on insuring their families after the
commissioners court approved offering some alternative health insurance plan
options to workers.


The McLennan County Commissioners Court voted to offer county employees two
alternative HMO plans that feature lower monthly premiums in exchange for
slightly higher routine medical expenses.


The plans were recommended by a
nine-member committee of county officials who sought options to lower employee
family health care costs.


The two alternatives, one from Scott & White and another from First Care, will
be offered in addition to the three base plans and monthly family-rate premiums
of $874.81 and $878.47, respectively.


However, health insurance premiums for employees' families currently range up to
$1,437, depending on the plan the employee is enrolled in.


There are some key differences in the plans.


The office visit co-pay for both
alternates is $30, compared to $20 for the base plans.


The alternatives also
impose deductibles -- $1,000 individual deductibles for the First Care HMO and
$1,000 individual or $2,000 family deductible for the Scott &White HMO plan --
while the base plans do not.


Out-of-pocket expenses for surgery and
hospitalizations also will increase with the alternative plans.


The county's Scott & White base HMO plan premium will increase by 21 percent
from $370.52 this year to $446.96 for individuals for the upcoming fiscal year.


Of the 860 county employees, 616 use the Scott and White HMO plan, 157 are
enrolled in First Care HMO, and six use the First Care PPO plan.


Normally, each employee would receive health insurance credits up to the lowest
individual monthly premium cost, which in this case would be the $366.68 First
Care deductible.


That would mean the 616 county employees who currently use the
Scott & White base HMO insurance plan would have to bear that 21 percent
increase -- an additional $80.24 each month -- or switch to the First Care base
HMO plan or an alternative during the county's open enrollment period Aug. 3-7.


Whether the alternative plans will save the county any money on health insurance
costs remains to be seen.

Health Insurance: Make It Sufficient;
Super Top-Up plans are turning a boon in enhancing the health coverage

LENGTH: 856  words


Super Top-Up plans are turning a boon in enhancing the health coverage

Narendra Anand - Senior VP & Head GI, Bajaj Capital

M any of us feel relieved and protected having bought a health insurance plan.


Topping It Up

A top-up health insurance plan is a regular indemnity plan that covers
hospitalization costs but only after a threshold limit is crossed.


In insurance
parlance, this limit is called deductible.


A deductible is that portion of the
claim amount that is not covered by the insurer and has to be paid by the
insured person before the benefits of the policy can kick in.


So, if you already
have a health insurance policy or are covered by your employer, the deductible
limit can be paid by the employer's policy and anything above that limit by the
top-up cover.


The difference between a super top up plan and a top up plan lies in its
working.


In a top up plan, the reimbursement for medical expenses is for a
single illness.


In a super top-up plan, the expenses
covered are for all illnesses put together that occur during an entire year.


How it works

In a regular health insurance plan, expenses are reimbursed for up to the sum
insured on the policy.


In a top up/super top plan, the medical expenses are
covered on the basis of a threshold limit.


This threshold limit (also known as
compulsory deductibles) is the level from where the plan would start kicking in.


Any claims over and above this threshold limit would be entertained under top
up/super top up plans.


8,00,000
and aggregate deductible of Rs.


The aggregate deductible is the amount
that client's existing health insurance policy will pay for medical expenses
incurred.


2,00,000 (aggregate deductible) is paid
by him/her for current health insurance policy, the additional Rs.8,00,000 will
be paid by us.


Conclusion

As far as health insurance needs go, being covered under the corporate group
plan of your employer or buying a policy for a tiny sum insured of, say, Rs.1-2
lakh is not enough.


Medical costs have skyrocketed and the process to port health
insurance from a corporate plan to an individual plan is not smooth.


For such individuals, a
health insurance top-up plan is an excellent way to increase the cover while
keeping costs in check.


Things to remember before buying top up plan

Consider the exact requirement for self or for the family.


* The top-up plan's
deductible should be less than or equal to the base policy sum insured.


* Top-up plans provide dual benefits of low cost and higher sum insured.


*For the salaried, who are covered under employer's health insurance policy
should also buy a top-up plan for higher protection.


Build them into your healthcare planning.

Spartanburg County Council to discuss health insurance plan at Monday's meeting

BYLINE: Felicia Kitzmiller, Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.


During the spring budget process, County Administrator Katherine O'Neill
presented a plan that called for design changes to the plan -- including a
smoking surcharge and eliminating dependents with other insurance options -- and
premium increases.


O'Neill presented a plan that would moderate the premium increase and
cut the county budget across the board by 3.5 percent.


Council instead approved
a plan to cut the entire county budget by 5 percent and fully fund insurance.


That plan was protested by some county officials, who said such a cut would
dramatically reduce services.


Council later voted to pursue the state insurance plan, but instructed O'Neill
to bid out the county's plan and find out if there were any alternatives.


Council members were told any option, including moving to the state health
insurance plan, would leave the county in the red this budget year.


Moving to
the state plan would leave the county about $500,000 over budget this year, and
staying self-insured would leave the county about $1.5 million over budget.


While moving to the state plan could provide the county some savings next year,
O'Neill said it is likely those savings would be erased in 2016 when the
county's rates are reassessed.


Several council members have expressed a reluctance to continue pursuing the
state plan.


Chairman Jeff Horton said he did not have all of the salient
information when he cast a vote during the budget process in favor of moving to
the state plan.


Councilwoman Jane Hall has said she plans to make a motion
Monday to reverse the decision to join the state plan.


The city of Spartanburg, for example, is also on a self-funded plan,
and it assesses a surcharge for smokers, disqualifies dependents with other
avenues for insurance and has various wellness incentives.


About 5 percent of Spartanburg County's insurance
pool is retirees, and they make up 16 percent of the cost of the county's plan.


A representative of Anderson County said it allows retirees to buy into the
state health insurance plan through the county, but also makes no contributions
toward premiums.

Healthcare and medical planning

SECTION: Business; Pg.


What sort of medical plans are there in the market?


While these plans may sound the same, there are a number of major and
minor differences and it is best to do your own research over the Internet
to familiarise yourself with the terms or contact some insurance companies
and ask all the questions you need before deciding on a plan.


However, there are four broad categories of health insurance in the
Malaysian market - group health insurance, hospitalisation benefit plan,
hospital and surgical plan, and accident and/or critical illness plan.


Under the hospitalisation benefit plan, the insurance company will pay
you a fixed amount on a per night basis for the extent of your stay in the
hospital regardless of the actual amount incurred.


The advantage of this plan is that the amount is paid on top of whatever
other health insurance plans you already have.


The hospital and surgical plan is fairly self-explanatory.


Some people make the mistake of paying for
two such plans, which is unnecessary as this plan operates on a
reimbursement format.


This means you can only collect once from one
company, regardless of how many other such plans you have paid for.


This hassle-free medical plan is gaining
increasing popularity.


The accident and critical illness plan is also self-explanatory.


The
plan pays a fixed lump sum plus any other bonus - if your plan comes with
it - upon the occurrence of an accident or a diagnosis of any one of the
major illnesses listed in the insurance contract.


This plan is highly advisable, as such major illnesses would not only
rack up high medical fees but also jeapordise your income earning ability.


However, it is also advisable to read the fine print for these types of
packages as some plans specify coverage in only in cases of accident.


Ultimately, the cost and range of protection provided by your health
insurance would depend on your insurance provider and the policy you buy.


While price - or in this case, the premium you can afford - is an
important consideration, there could be other factors influencing your
decision when it comes to choosing a health insurance plan.


Check certain details such as the limit in plans like hospitalisation
and surgical benefits and exclusion clauses detailing items or illnesses
not covered by the plan.

City Manager Michael V. O'Brien is delaying until July 1 health care costs
reforms for municipal and public school retirees enrolled in conventional city
health insurance plans.


Retirees who choose to remain on conventional health insurance plans will pay 20
percent of their health insurance premium costs, while the city will pay 80
percent, the manager said.


There will also be a three-tiered drug prescription co-pay ($10/$20/$35)
compared to the two-tiered plan ($5/$10) that now exists, and office visit
co-pays will increase from $5 to $10.


"I will institute a thorough outreach to these retirees on conventional plans to
provide them all the information necessary as to the various opportunities
available during open enrollment," Mr. O'Brien said.


"Additional information
sessions will be held for all retirees to learn more about this topic and to
better prepare for the changes in plan designs."


Retirees objected
to the plan as a whole, while several city councilors roundly criticized the
process and timing used by the manager, calling it a "major mistake" on his
part.


He said his
planned changes for retirees alone would save the city $2 million.


But after several city councilors criticized the process used by the manager,
Mr. O'Brien last Tuesday night agreed to delay implementing the plan one week,
so he could have more time to study the matter.


After further analysis and
weighing the concerns raised by the council, the manager decided to delay the
plan until July 1.


Mr. O'Brien said his decision to defer the health insurance reforms for retirees
on conventional plans has a cost associated with it of about $500,000.


"With this six-month deferment, I believe it provides these retirees the
opportunity to evaluate their health care plan choices and make informed choices
on these benefits," Mr. O'Brien said.


The reforms are intended to help put the brakes on the city's skyrocketing
health insurance costs and align its health plans with trends in both the public
and private industry.


There are 4,431 retirees enrolled in health insurance plans offered by the city.


Of that total, 2,731 are in Medicare supplemental plans.


Meanwhile, the remaining 1,700 retirees are in conventional active health plans,
such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield Blue Choice, Fallon Select and Fallon Direct.


Under those plans, the city picks up the tab for 87 percent of the premiums for
the Blue Cross plan it offers and 90 percent of the premiums for the plans
provided by Fallon.


UT changed its student health insurance policy to reflect national health care
reforms and the ability to purchase plans through a health insurance
marketplace, which began enrolling people in 2013.


The university will continue to offer insurance plans, and students may
voluntarily enroll if they are taking at least one credit hour per semester.


The change comes as a dwindling number of students elected to remain in UT
plans.


In fall of 2009, 4,253 students were insured through university-offered
plans.


Children are now allowed to remain on their parents' health insurance plans
until age 26.


Individuals also can purchase plans at various levels of coverage
through an online exchange established as part of Obamacare.


The options have resulted in fewer students enrolling in plans offered through
UT, Ms. Cunningham said.


For those without coverage in 2015, the fine is either 2 percent of
yearly household income or $325 per person, whichever is higher.


A single student on a domestic plan offered through UT pays $3,659 for a year of
coverage.


There is no deductible if the student goes to a UT provider.


The
annual deductible is $150 for in-network but off-campus provider and $300 for
out-of-network providers.


UT's plan is run by a subsidiary of Medical Mutual of Ohio and includes pharmacy
coverage.


At Bowling Green State University, a student registered for eight or more credit
hours on the main campus must either be covered by a health insurance plan that
meets BGSU's requirements or enroll in a BGSU student plan.


The
number has not dropped significantly since the introduction of marketplace
plans, officials said.


For a plan with a $1,500 deductible, a student pays $1,608 a year.


For a plan
with a $500 deductible, a student pays $1,786 annually.


The plans include
pharmacy coverage.


The provider is United HealthCare Student Resources.

Health insurance changes coming;
Budget stake could spear 131 jobs

BYLINE: Nick Kotsopoulos

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; POLITICS AND THE CITY; Pg.


That's because the fiscal 2012 municipal budget will largely be shaped by
whether City Manager Michael V. O'Brien is able to fully implement a plan he has
come up with to lower the city's budget-choking health insurance costs.


If he is unable to do so, he said, he will have no choice but to include 131
municipal employee layoffs in his fiscal 2012 budget proposal, which he plans on
presenting to the City Council in late April.


Even if the city's collective bargaining groups don't buy into the city
manager's health insurance plan at this time, it doesn't mean that the status
quo for health insurance will be maintained.


Municipal employees could very well
end up in a plan similar to what the manager has proposed not too far down the
road, only that plan would be administered by the state and there would be no
local control.


Deval L. Patrick's employee health care bill would require municipalities
and their unions to develop changes in their health insurance plans similar to
the state's health insurance pool administered by the Group Insurance
Commission.


Another bill before the Legislature, meanwhile, would grant cities and towns
universal authority to modify their health insurance plan designs, including
co-pays and deductibles.


Because he cannot afford to wait for the Legislature to act, Mr. O'Brien and his
administration have developed a new health insurance plan, in partnership with
local health care providers.


The new plan includes an innovative local health care network designed
specifically for city employees.


It incorporates provider discounts and an
improved medical management program that gives employees access to high-quality
health insurance providers.


Mr. O'Brien said the plan mirrors the state's GIC, but it maintains local
control.


He said the plan would include lower premiums for the city and
employees.


In turn, however, employees would have to pay deductibles and tiered
co-payments that are similar to those in GIC health plans and higher than what
they pay now.


Last week, Mr. O'Brien announced he is moving all municipal employees not
represented by a collective bargaining group into that new health plan,
effective July 1.


The movement of those 630 employees off traditional health
insurance plans to a GIC-like health plan is expected to save the non-school
side of the municipal government up to $500,000.


Mr. O'Brien said if all other city-side employees were to agree to move into
that plan it would reduce the city's fiscal 2012 deficit by $5 million.


City Manager O'Brien, meanwhile, said he has already had discussions about his
plan with the leadership of the city-side municipal unions and the Insurance
Advisory Committee, and is willing to discuss it further with them.

Deadline approaches for insurance penalty

BYLINE: Sedona Red Rock News staff

LENGTH: 489  words


As the Monday, March 31, deadline for buying health insurance gets closer, I
wanted to tell you about alternative ways to purchase a health plan --
especially if you have a higher income.


Many lower-income Arizonans will qualify for lower costs on their coverage, but
only if they purchase it through the Health InsuranceMarketplace, at the
government website.


Eligibility for lower costs on health coverage is based on your income and
household, size.


Generally, you won't qualify if your estimated 2014 income is
above $45,960 for an individual.


For a family of four, the income cutoff is
$94,200.


If you don't qualify for lower costs based on your income, you can get
coverage in one of the following ways:

Directly from an insurance company.


You can contact any health insurance company
and see plans available in your area.


Many have websites that let you compare
all plans available from that company.


Brokers generally sell plans from a number of
companies.


They can help you compare plans based on features and price and
complete your enrollment.


You don't pay more by using an agent or broker since
they're generally paid by the insurance company whose plans they sell.


These services offer health insurance
plans from a number of insurance companies.


You can apply and enroll through the
Health Insurance Marketplace website whether or not you qualify for lower costs
based on your income.


No matter how you buy them, health insurance plans generally offer the same set
of essential health benefits, free preventive services, coverage for preexisting
conditions and other rights and protections under the Affordable Care Act.


Most plans available outside the Marketplace meet the requirement to provide
adequate coverage under the ACA.


But keep in mind that not all plans you buy outside the Marketplace meet the
adequacy requirement.


Most insurers must tell you if the plan you're buying qualifies as coverage
under the ACA.


After open enrollment ends, generally the only way you can buy a health
insurance plan is if you have a qualifying life event that gives you a special
enrollment period.


2017 Option Transfer Period



 The Option Transfer Period is the time of year when all employees eligible for
health insurance may make changes to their New York State Health Insurance
Program (NYSHIP) plan option for the 2017 plan year.


This includes changes
from:



      A NYSHIP HMO to The Empire Plan

     The Empire Plan to a NYSHIP HMO

     One NYSHIP HMO to another NYSHIP HMO

     A NYSHIP health plan to the Opt-Out Program

 The deadline for changing health insurance options is December 16, 2016.


The incentive payments are

Mitt Romney, an architect of Massachusetts' universal health coverage plan, is
unveiling his proposal for overhauling the nation's health care system, calling
for a state-by-state approach that he says will help millions of uninsured in
this country gain access to affordable medical coverage.


''He's run away from the Massachusetts plan,'' said Stuart Altman, a health
economist at Brandeis University who worked in the Nixon administration and has
helped advise many politicians since, including Senator Barack Obama, a
Democratic presidential contender.


The Massachusetts plan, which went into effect this year and is still being
watched closely to see how it will fare, was Mr. Romney's signal legislative
accomplishment as governor but has  elements that trouble many conservatives,
most notably a mandate that everyone who can afford it must buy health insurance
or face penalties.


There is no individual mandate in Mr. Romney's plan for the rest of the country.


According to a preview of the presentation provided by Mr. Romney's policy
advisers yesterday, Mr. Romney will highlight how the nearly 45 million
uninsured in the country can be divided into roughly three groups: about a third
are eligible for public programs but are not enrolled; a third are low income
but ineligible for public programs and need some help from the government to
purchase health insurance; a third are middle income but have chosen not to buy
health insurance.


In his plan, Mr. Romney proposes taking federal money currently being used to
help states cover the cost of medical care for the uninsured and offering that
money to states to help low-income people who are not eligible for Medicaid and
other public programs to buy their own private health insurance.


The same pool of money will be wielded as a carrot for states to reform their
health insurance regulations to help drive costs down and make plans affordable.


That would include reducing the number of requirements for coverage that states
impose on health insurance providers or lifting restrictions in some states on
health maintenance organizations.


''For those people who are middle income or higher, a lot of times they're
making a basic calculation that it's too expensive to buy health insurance,''
said Sally Canfield, Mr. Romney's policy director.


So Mr. Romney wants to allow people
who buy their own health insurance to be able to deduct premiums, deductibles
and co-payments from their income.


Eventually, Ms. Canfield said, the goal would be for people to be able to opt
out of employer plans if they do not like them and go out on the individual
market to buy health insurance on their own.


Other elements of Mr. Romney's plan include altering the federal financing for
state Medicaid programs to encourage restructuring by states and even helping
low-income people buy private coverage, as well as capping punitive damages on
medical liability lawsuits.


Several experts, however, questioned the viability of aspects of Mr. Romney's
plan, including whether the proposed tax incentives will be enough to spur
individuals to buy health insurance, without any consequences like they face in
Massachusetts if they do not.

Bush Seeks Shift in Health Coverage;
He Would Tax Those With Higher-Priced Plans, Give Breaks for Buying Cheaper Ones

BYLINE: Michael A. Fletcher, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: A Section; A04

LENGTH: 1047 words


President Bush will propose a deep tax break for Americans who purchase their
own medical insurance and would finance it with an unprecedented tax on a
portion of high-priced health-care plans that workers receive from their
employers, according to the White House.


And it would rein in the soaring cost of health insurance by encouraging
workers in high-priced plans to seek more modest coverage.


"It unwisely encourages workers to choose overly
expensive, gold-plated plans.


The proposal, which Bush plans to fully unveil in Tuesday's State of the Union
address, marks a sharp departure for a president who has been criticized for
advocating tax cuts that disproportionately benefit higher-income Americans.


Administration officials familiar with the plan say it reflects the new
political order in Washington, where Democrats now control both chambers of
Congress.


They refuse to characterize the plan as a tax increase because it
raises no new money for the federal government.


Instead, it would add a new tax
on employer-provided health-care plans worth more than $15,000 to subsidize
those who buy modestly priced plans out of their pockets.


In addition, they say, the plan is consistent with the president's idea of
increasing access to health insurance through the private market while
encouraging people to be more cost-conscious as they purchase medical-care
coverage.


In his speech Tuesday night, the president will also propose increasing the
federal assistance to states that make private health-care plans available to
low-income or chronically unhealthy people who are uninsured.


Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) recently announced a plan to provide
coverage to about 6.5 million people, including many recent immigrants, who are
uninsured.


If the plan is approved by the state legislature, California would
become the fourth state  --  along with Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine  --  to
offer near-universal health insurance.


He has
also advocated health savings accounts, consumer-driven plans with higher
deductibles and lower premiums than those in traditional insurance.


The average employer-provided family health insurance plan costs
$11,500 a year, administration officials said  --  three times what it cost 19
years ago.


People with families who buy low-cost policies, meanwhile, would have their
taxable income reduced by $15,000, regardless of the cost of the plans and
whether they itemize deductions on their tax returns.


The deduction, to be indexed to account for
inflation, would also be extended to those with employer-provided plans, to be
offset by the cost of their coverage.


The Bush administration estimates that 80 percent of people with
employer-provided plans would see their tax liability fall because the deduction
would be larger than the value of their insurance plans.


Underlying the idea is the belief that the current tax structure
essentially adds to the inflationary pressure on health care by subsidizing
expensive health-care plans, making coverage even more unaffordable for those
who do not have it.


Still, some leading Democrats are skeptical of the plan.

MANY consumers are now considering alternative healthcare plans as the cost of
health insurance continues to soar.


Cash plans Medical cash or hospital cash plans have been on the market for
some time.


Some plans include a hospital cash benefit which gives
you a cash grant for every night you are in hospital irrespective of whether you
have health insurance or not.


HSF plans HSF is one of the leading providers in the market and has a range of
health cash plans to suit a range of requirements.


It now provides plans for both individuals and families which provide 100pc
cover for many of the benefits listed above.


Unlike health insurance, a

has a range of Health Family and Health Individual cash plans.


Laya Healthcare
offers a range of Money Smart plans for families and individuals as do GloHealth
with their 'Hospital Care' ' options.


Prices range from (EURO)123 to (EURO)1,056
per year depending on the plan or provider selected.


These plans normally provide full cover for dental examinations; up to 70pc
cover for extractions/fillings; and allowances for treatments such as crowns and
some orthodontic cases.


Combinations The existence of these plans means that medical cover is not just

West Virginians will have fewer options for choosing health plans on the Health
Insurance Marketplace than people in most other parts of the country, according
to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.


Uninsured West Virginians can choose from 12 health insurance plans beginning
Oct. 1, according to the report.


On average, Americans will have 53 plans to
choose from in the 36 states where the federal government will run or support
the Health Insurance Marketplace.


Depending on the state, people will have as few as six and as many as 169 plans
to choose from in their marketplaces.


Plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace are divided into categories: platinum,
gold, silver and bronze.


Platinum plans have the highest premiums and lowest out-of-pocket costs.


Bronze
plans have the lowest premiums and the highest out-of-pocket costs.


Based on income levels, some residents will get tax credits for their insurance
costs.


In West Virginia, before tax credits, a 27-year-old person would pay an
estimated $185 a month for the lowest bronze plan, $218 a month for the lowest
silver plan, $266 a month for the lowest gold plan, and $169 a month for the
lowest catastrophic plan, according to the report.


A 27-year-old making $25,000 a year would have paid $218 a month before tax
credits but will pay $145 a month after tax credits for the second-lowest silver
plan.


The same person would pay $112 a month for the lowest bronze plans after
tax credits, according to the report.


A family of four making $50,000 a year will pay $789 a month before tax credits
and $282 a month after tax credits for the second-lowest silver plan.


The same
family will pay $161 a month for the lowest-bronze plan after tax credits,
according to the report.

Health plan hike delayed;
Midyear change called unfair

BYLINE: Nick Kotsopoulos, TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

LENGTH: 619 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER


City Manager Michael V. O'Brien is delaying for at least one week implementing
his plan to increase the health insurance premiums for municipal and public
school retirees, and requiring them to pay more for doctor office visits and
prescription drugs.


Several city councilors made it clear last night they would like to see Mr.
O'Brien postpone the plan until next spring, when the next open enrollment
period for health insurance will be held.


They said it would be grossly unfair to
retirees to have their premiums increased and changes made to their benefit
plans while in the middle of the current contract.


More than 70 retirees attended the council meeting to express their displeasure
with Mr. O'Brien's plan.


He said the reforms are needed to put
the brakes on the city's skyrocketing health insurance costs and align its
health plans with trends in both the public and private industry.


He said his planned changes for retirees
alone would save the city $2 million.


The retirees were informed of the plan in letters they received from the city
last weekend.


Mayor Timothy P. Murray said employees and retirees who signed up for their
current health plans during the last open enrollment period in the spring did so
with the understanding there would not be any changes made to their plans during
the middle of the year.


"Halfway through this year, and we are now telling these people that we're going
to make changes to their health plans," Mr. Murray said.


But, he
said, the city manager made a "major mistake" by seeking to make changes to the
retirees' health plans in the middle of the year.


But, she added,
the city should honor the year's commitment on retirees' current health
insurance plans.


McCain's idea
is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own
health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by
tax incentives.


So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer-provided
health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit to spend on
any health insurance they wish.


They might choose to use their employer's plan
and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go
off and buy insurance on their own.


Obama's plan expands existing system

The statement

Under Barack Obama's health care proposal, "if you've got a health care plan
that you like, you can keep it."


The ruling

Opponents have attacked Obama's plan as "government-run" health care, but he's
accurately describing the plan here.


Obama's
plan essentially takes today's system and seeks to expand it to the uninsured.


Obama has said he would like his
plan to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage.


Obama has said that he did not include
a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.


It
remains to be seen whether Obama's plan will actually be able to achieve the
cost savings it promises for the health care system.


But people who want to keep
their current insurance should be able to do that under Obama's plan.


His
description of his plan is accurate, and we rate his statement True.


Small businesses exempt from plan

The statement

Barack Obama's health care plan calls for "mandates and fines for small
businesses."


The ruling

Obama's plan expands health care coverage for those who don't have it by a
number of strategies, such as creating national pools for individuals to buy
insurance.


Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except
for children.


Obama said often during the Democratic primary that he did not
include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.


Obama's plan says that employers who don't offer their
employees insurance will be required to contribute to the national pool.


Obama's
plan exempts small businesses from contributing to the pool.


Health care ad is right - until the end

The statement

John McCain's health care plan "leaves you on your own to pay McCain's health
insurance tax."


They might choose to use their
employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or
they might go off and buy insurance on their own.


Ideally, this will increase
competition among health care plans.


There's ample
evidence that the plan would be a wash for most workers.


The McCain campaign
says only those with "gold-plated" coverage would do worse.


An analysis from the
nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms it: "In general, lower-income people with
health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in
excess of the value that they receive from today's tax exemption."


So McCain's
health plan does not leave you "on your own" to pay a health insurance tax.


His
plan gives you a credit to work with.


Their past positions and their plans

JOHN MCCAIN

-Ends the longtime tax exemption on employer-provided health insurance and
replaces it with a $2,500 credit.


This move aims to create more competition
among health insurance providers and improve efficiency.


-Will ask the states to help create coverage plans to insure those with
pre-existing conditions.


BARACK OBAMA

-Workers who like their health care plan keep their coverage.


By 2018, McCain's plan would cost $1.3-billion; Obama's plan would
cost $1.6-billion.


McCain's idea
is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own
health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by
tax incentives.


So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer-provided
health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit to spend on
any health insurance they wish.


They might choose to use their employer's plan
and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go
off and buy insurance on their own.


Obama's plan expands existing system

The statement

Under Barack Obama's health care proposal, "if you've got a health care plan
that you like, you can keep it."


The ruling

Opponents have attacked Obama's plan as "government-run" health care, but he's
accurately describing the plan here.


Obama's
plan essentially takes today's system and seeks to expand it to the uninsured.


Obama has said he would like his
plan to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage.


Obama has said that he did not include
a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.


It
remains to be seen whether Obama's plan will actually be able to achieve the
cost savings it promises for the health care system.


But people who want to keep
their current insurance should be able to do that under Obama's plan.


His
description of his plan is accurate, and we rate his statement True.


Small businesses exempt from plan

The statement

Barack Obama's health care plan calls for "mandates and fines for small
businesses."


The ruling

Obama's plan expands health care coverage for those who don't have it by a
number of strategies, such as creating national pools for individuals to buy
insurance.


Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except
for children.


Obama said often during the Democratic primary that he did not
include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.


Obama's plan says that employers who don't offer their
employees insurance will be required to contribute to the national pool.


Obama's
plan exempts small businesses from contributing to the pool.


Health care ad is right - until the end

The statement

John McCain's health care plan "leaves you on your own to pay McCain's health
insurance tax."


They might choose to use their
employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or
they might go off and buy insurance on their own.

CORRECTION: CORRECTION: In a PolitiFact story about the cost of the presidential
candidates' health care plans, an incorrect figure was listed.


The correct
figures: By 2018, John McCain's plan would cost $1.3-trillion; Barack Obama's
plan would cost $1.6-trillion.


The plans are said to be about 15% cheaper than the nearest reference points in
the market, because not all hospitals are covered.


Alison Burns, chief executive of Aviva Health Insurance, said: "These plans are
designed to focus on what matters most to our customers by giving them more
choice, so that they're not paying for benefits they don't want, or for access
to hospitals that aren't a priority for them."


Industry experts said that the new plans from Aviva marked the start of a new
era in the health insurance market.


Other health insurers look set to follow Aviva's move by launching their own
range of cut-price plans in the coming months.


On the day Aviva unveiled its
Focus plans, Laya Healthcare issued a statement saying that it would soon be
announcing details of schemes covering selected hospitals.


We outline what Aviva's new plans offer and give you expert advice on how to get
the best deal on cover.


NEW PLANS Aviva's six new plans are: Value Focus, Day2Day Focus, First Focus,
Future Focus, Family Focus and Hospital Focus.


They are of varying
affordability, ranging in price from (EURO)525 a year for the Value Focus plan
to (EURO)1,170 for the Hospital Focus plan.


For consumers where price is the main consideration, the Value Focus plan will
be of interest, according to healthinsurancecomparisons.


This plan provides basic hospital cover in private hospitals and certain
public hospitals and costs (EURO)525 a year.


You still maintain full coverage
for MRI and CT scans on this plan in approved centres.


One of the new products, the First Focus plan, is aimed at men.


The First Focus plan, which costs (EURO)765 a year, provides access to a mix of
both public and private hospitals.


ie recommends the Hospital Focus plan for older people, and advises them to
prioritise for the unexpected and maintain access to comprehensive cardiac
cover.


With all the new plans, if you suffer an accident and need to be taken to a
hospital not within your network of covered hospitals, you still get the same
level of cover.


ie, an adviser, said that, while the new plans will help some people to remain
in the private hospital system, consumers should carefully study what's on
offer.


"These new offerings should be met with caution as they will mean a significant
reduction in benefits on certain plans, primarily a 40% reduction in the number
of public and private hospitals that will be covered," said Goode.


"It is imperative that before people dash out to accept the lowest premium that
they carefully look at the particular plan on offer and make an informed
decision as to whether or not that this is the best plan for them," he said.


He said that a lot of people go on plans with GP and physio cover, which makes
sense only if you are a frequent visitor to these practitioners.


Under health insurance regulations, an insurer must sell
you the policy you request irrespective of to whom the plan is marketed.


"Always ask about corporate plans as they are often not advertised to the normal
consumer," said Behan.


SPLIT COVER A lot of parents make the mistake of adding their children to the
same policy that they are on instead of looking at their child's individual
requirements and selecting plans based on these needs.


You can have
everyone on the one policy, but on different plans within that policy."


"You have 14 days after your renewal date, known as the cooling-off period,
within which you can cancel your cover, or switch to another provider," said
Goode.


Cancelling during the term of your policy will likely result in an early
termination fee from your existing provider.


Julie and Paul Mulvihill, and their two boys, Adam, 10, and Gavin, 9, made
savings of (EURO)1,400 on their annual health insurance bill by switching to
Aviva's new Focus range of hospital plans.


The family, who live in Knocklyon, Co Dublin, were previously on a plan that
covered them for admissions into all public and private hospitals.


Their old
plans also covered the whole family for routine medical expenses and maternity
benefits.


ie, the Mulvihills switched to Aviva's new health plans.


Julie wasn't concerned
at losing access to certain hospitals under the new plans.


Julie and Paul decided to cover themselves under the First Focus plan while
insuring their children under the Family Focus plan.


Their plan doesn't cover day-to-day medical expenses such as GP visits, while
the plan that their children are on provides hospital cover as well as cover for
GP visits.


Children over the age of five get cover under the Family
Focus plan for a discounted price of (EURO)150 a child until August 26.


Julie was unaware that she could save money by selecting plans based on the
different requirements of each family member - previously everyone was on the
same plan.


"HSA-eligible policies now fill an important niche for
employers and individual purchasers, and America's health insurance plans
continue to make them a valuable part of the suite of products they offer."


The study was based on responses to a survey from 99 AHIP members, who
collectively represent nearly all of the health insurance plans offering
HSA-eligible plans.


Lower premium HSA plans are an important option, particularly for people who
might have trouble paying for other types of coverage, Ignagni says, adding that
the survey response showed 37% of individual policies were purchased by those
who had been previously uninsured.


Of the policies sold in the small group
market, 27% were sold to employers who did not offer coverage prior to the HSA
plan purchase.


HSAs were created by Congress in late 2003 as part of the Medicare drug bill,
with subsequent guidance on the specifics of how the plans should work issued by
the Internal Revenue Service.


"Most of these plans rely on networks of doctors and hospitals to give consumers
access to the same kinds of negotiated discounts available to participants in
other health insurance plans, stretching the consumers' health care dollar and
increasing the value of the HSA-eligible plan," Ignagni says.

Health plan to cover treatment abroad

BYLINE: Yomiuri

SECTION: Pg.

LENGTH: 278 words


The government on Monday decided to revise the national health insurance law to
provide coverage for overseas medical treatment under the public insurance plan.


The Health and Welfare Ministry plans to submit a bill to revise the law during
the next ordinary Diet session after it is scrutinized by the ministry's council
of medical insurance and welfare as early as next month.


National health insurance, which is mainly taken out by farmers and the
self-employed, is the nation's only medical insurance plan that does not cover
overseas medical treatment.


Prompted by complaints from policyholders, the Management and Coordination
Agency will soon ask the Health and Welfare Ministry to discuss the plan and
draft a bill.


In response to an increase in globalization in the business sector and the
number of Japanese business people traveling overseas for longer periods of
time, health insurance societies that serve employees of large corporations and
health insurance plans for workers of small and medium-sized companies have
covered overseas medical treatment, including during personal trips, since 1981.


For example, payments for overseas medical treatment for employees of small and
medium-sized companies insured under health insurance plans totaled about 200
million yen in fiscal 1997.


Due to constraints on the national coffers, however, coverage of overseas
medical costs under the national health insurance plan was postponed, as
self-employed workers and farmers were not perceived as frequent business
travelers.

Town hall offers dose of advice on health plans

More than 5.3 million uninsured people in California qualify for coverage
through Covered California, and more than 2.6 million people qualify for plans
that are federally subsidized.


Here are highlights from the meeting:

Covered California

 Covered California is a health insurance exchange with negotiated rates, not a
health plan, said John Lewis, East Los Angeles Community Union's Covered
California outreach and education project coordinator for Orange County.


"Whether it's Blue Shield, Health Net, Kaiser (Permanente), all these different
health plans that you may have seen before or you bought insurance from before,
those are still the individuals that are going to provide health insurance."


Health insurance plans will include, at minimum, the following benefits:
ambulance patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and
newborn care, mental health and substance abuse disorders, prescription drugs,
rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, lab services, preventive
and wellness services and chronic disease management, and pediatric services,
Lewis said.


Insurance providers cannot refuse services or deny people from joining a health
insurance plan because of pre-existing health conditions, Lewis said.


Also,
people can stay with their current health plan if they wish to do so.


Medi-Cal

 Medi-Cal income eligibility is increased to a minimum of $15,000 for
individuals and $32,000 for a family of four, said Arif Shaikh, legislative
affairs manager for CalOptima.


2017 Option Transfer Period



 The Option Transfer Period is the time of year when all employees eligible for
health insurance may make changes to their New York State Health Insurance
Program (NYSHIP) plan option for the 2017 plan year.


This includes changes
from:



      A NYSHIP HMO to The Empire Plan

     The Empire Plan to a NYSHIP HMO

     One NYSHIP HMO to another NYSHIP HMO

     A NYSHIP health plan to the Opt-Out Program

 The deadline for changing health insurance options is December 16, 2016.

June 01--If Elkin's 2011-12 budget is approved next month, all town employees
will receive a higher base salary, merit compensation and an improved health
insurance plan.


Town employees would also have the option of signing up for a health insurance
plan that offers more comprehensive coverage than does the current plan, which
offers employees and their families only basic health coverage.


Our employees' plans are way below those of our peer cities," said
Payne.


Both the town's current and prospective plans are
through the Municipal Insurance Trust of North Carolina, which is sponsored by
the NC League of Municipalities.


Elkin Assistant Town Manager/Financial Director John Holcomb added, "We are on
the lowest plan offered by the League of Municipalities currently."


While the proposed plan would lower deductibles and copays for primary and
specialist visits from $30 and $40 to $20 and $30, respectively, it would
particularly benefit town employees who cover their children on their health
insurance.


The rate for employees and children would drop from $543 in the
town's current health insurance plan to $378 under the new plan.


With a four percent increase to the town's current health insurance plan
anticipated in the coming year, commissioners believed it a good time for an
upgrade.


Lowe also supported the upgraded health
insurance plan.


Although not directly challenging a transition to the new plan, Commissioner
Cicely McCulloch added to the discussion, "I have a basic plan myself, and the
lower the copay, the more often you go to the doctor."


Still, commissioners ultimately agreed to budget an additional $17,322 for the
proposed plan, bringing Elkin's total health insurance bill to $30,096 -- a 9.5
percent increase from last year.


North Carolinians must enroll in a health insurance plan by Dec. 15 in
order to receive coverage by Jan. 1.


The marketplace plans are
affordable, and meet consumers' needs and budgets.


For most, there are fines for not purchasing a health insurance plan.


Each adult
without health insurance will have to pay $325 or two percent of their annual
household income, whichever is greater, the following year for not purchasing
health insurance.


"It's crucial that North Carolinians are aware that there are deadlines and
fines associated with not enrolling in a health insurance plan," said Lee Dixon,
project coordinator for NC Get Covered.


"While North Carolina was one of the few
states to reach its enrollment goal last year, there is still work to be done to
ensure that everyone finds the best health insurance plan for their needs and
budget.


NC Get Covered is available for all North Carolinians to help ease the
burden of finding the right health insurance plan."

Medicare to offer 4 new health plans

BYLINE: Laura Williamson; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: STATE NEWS; Pg.


01A

LENGTH: 321 words


By the end of the year, metro Atlanta and north Georgia Medicare patients will
have four new health plans to choose from.


The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in Washington, which runs the
federal health insurance program for the elderly, announced today it had
selected 25 managed care plans from eight cities and five rural areas nationwide
to take part in a pilot program dubbed Medicare Choices.


Hundreds of thousands of senior citizens in metro Atlanta and north Georgia
could begin enrolling in one of the four Georgia plans chosen as early as this
summer, HCFA officials said.


All plans are expected to be open to patients by
December.


HCFA officials said the program will test ways to save taxpayers money by
enrolling senior citizens in a range of managed care plans, some similar to
those offered by private employers.


Georgia's Medicare options will include plans run by hospitals and doctors, a
new way of providing health insurance also emerging in the private sector.


"This is our chance to prove that we don't have to be micromanaged by insurance
companies to provide health care," said Don Hutton, chairman and CEO of the
Morgan Health Group, a network of 300 primary care physicians in the Atlanta
area and one of the four Georgia plans chosen by HCFA.


The others are plans run by St. Joseph's Health System, Georgia Baptist Health
Care System and Value Health Inc.

Senior citiizens who don't want to enroll in one of the new plans won't have to.


But some plans will try to entice them by covering services not included in
Medicare, such as annual dental exams and prescription drugs, allowing them to
drop costly Medigap policies.


Seniors will continue to pay their $ 46 monthly
Medicare premiums no matter which plan they choose.


When she does, she will no
longer be considered my ''dependent'' under my company's group health insurance
plan, so she will not have any health insurance coverage.


A: Your daughter
should be able to continue her health insurance coverage through your employer's
health insurance plan for up to 36 months.


In many instances, if an employee or
an employee's dependent loses health care coverage under an employer's group
health plan, that person must be given the right to continue the coverage, at
his or her own expense.


Under the law, your daughter would be eligible to continue
her health insurance coverage even though she is no longer considered your
''dependent'' under your employer's health insurance plan.


To do this, one of
you must notify the plan administrator of the plan shortly before your daughter
''technically'' is no longer your dependent.


The group
health plan is required by law to provide the continuation coverage for at least
36 months from the time your daughter is no longer considered to be your
dependent under the plan.


This maximum period can be shortened if your daughter
does not pay any required premium payment on time (if she is obligated to do so)
or if she becomes covered under another employer's group health plan, as an
employee or otherwise.

Blunt offers health insurance plan

BYLINE: By Virginia Young POST-DISPATCH JEFFERSON CITY BUREAU CHIEF

SECTION: METRO; Pg.


Matt Blunt unveiled a plan Thursday that he said would help low-income,
working adults buy health insurance.


The plan's centerpiece is a state clearinghouse that would let small businesses
pool their risks.


Workers would pick a plan and pay their share of the cost with tax-free dollars.


Blunt said the plan would "significantly expand the number of people who have
access to health insurance."


Experts called the governor's plan a good first step.


But Watson and some Democrats said the plan would do nothing for people below
the poverty level who lost Medicaid coverage two years ago.


Some were elderly or
disabled and won't qualify for employer-based plans.


It includes those dropped because the Legislature tightened eligibility, as well
as those who were declared ineligible when Blunt began verifying recipients'
incomes.


House Small Business Committee Chairman Doug Ervin, R-Kearney, has introduced
the governor's plan.


Ervin said he hopes the plan would reduce the number of uninsured by at least 20
percent.


The plan unveiled Thursday follows Blunt's goal of subsidizing the purchase of
private insurance instead of expanding public programs.


His pooling plan would establish a quasi-governmental entity called the Missouri
Health Insurance Exchange.


Brad Jones, who lobbies for the National Federation of Independent Business,
said the governor's plan would let employees choose an insurance plan that fits
their needs.


I wish to top up my health insurance plan on my own.


Once I approach the insurance provider, is there any medical
examination?


Top-up health insurance plans provide an extra health care financing shield for
you in the most economical way, especially, when you have an employer-provided
base health insurance cover.


You can easily top up your current health insurance
policy, by either contacting an agent or reviewing various top-up options on the
Internet.You should ideally look for a top-up policy that gives you an option to
convert to a full-fledged health insurance plan close to your retirement.


To buy a top-up plan, all you need to do is to fill up an online application
form.


Most insurance companies do not ask for a medical examination while
purchasing a top-up plan of up to Rs.


First off, let me congratulate you for buying a top-up plan at a young age to
mitigate rising healthcare costs.


Top-up plans are often underrated plans and
their importance is clear when you leave a job and the new employer does not
offer a similar policy or offers a reduced cover.


You can certainly claim a tax rebate for your top-up plan as per The Income Tax
Act, Section 80D.


Having said that, a health insurance
policy should be viewed as a financial planning tool to mitigate rising
healthcare costs and not just as a tax saving tool.


It provides low-cost, subsidized health insurance for poorer residents, but
higher income individuals must purchase private-pay plans.


About 300,000 people have signed up for health care plans since enrollment
started last year, including about 160,000 in the new state-subsidized plan
called Commonwealth Care.


It covers those who earn too much for the state's
Medicaid health plan, known as MassHealth, but too little to afford private
plans.


About 63,000 individuals have signed up for private-pay plans since the law went
into effect, state officials said.


"The penalty for 2007 was relatively modest," said Richard Powers, spokesman for
the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state entity that handles enrollment in
state subsidized health-care plans.


The penalties are based on one-half the lowest cost plan available through the
Connector.


In 2009, the cost of that type of plans will go up since residents
will be required to have prescription coverage as part of their basic health
insurance plan.


The cheapest health-care plan available today to a 27-year-old privately insured
Boston resident, for example, is $193.81 a month, and that doesn't include
prescription coverage, Powers said.


The information about what plans people have will be
checked against a state database.


People are taking the penalties seriously, said Estelle Fritzinger, head of the
Community Action Committee of the Cape and Islands, which has a state contract
to enroll people in subsidized plans.


Joyce Brennan, public information officer for the Southcoast Hospitals Group in
Southeastern Massachusetts said lower-income patients have been happy to sign up
for the state's new health insurance plans once they learn how to access the
system.

Looking to buy a diabetes insurance plan?


The probability of having to pay large hospital bills, therefore, increases and
unless one has a dedicated and exclusive diabetes insurance plan, much of it
will have to be borne from one's own pocket.


According to an Association of
Physicians of India study, the urban poor spend as much as 34 per cent, while
their rural counterparts spend 27 per cent of their income on diabetes
treatment.


So how about buying a diabetes health insurance plan?


What's more, there is no
waiting period in the diabetes specific insurance plans.


"Diabetes insurance
plans are specialised insurance plans focused on providing coverage on
treatments or expenses for people who suffer from diabetes," says Mahavir
Chopra, Director - Health, Life & Strategic Initiatives, Coverfox.com.


Diabetes insurance plans may be standalone and specifically covering the disease
or a part of a regular Mediclaim plan after paying extra premium.


Varishta
Mediclaim from National Insurance and Care Freedom from Religare Health
Insurance are two such plans, but they cater only to senior citizens.


'Diabetes
Safe' from Star Health Insurance and 'Energy' from Apollo Munich Health
Insurance are two exclusive diabetes insurance plans which anyone within the
eligible age bracket can buy, unlike the previous two.


The need for diabetes specific insurance plan

For a healthy individual, having a health cover plan like a Mediclaim, with
adequate sum insured, could be enough to meet the hospitalisation costs arising
out of a diabetic situation.


Therefore, on detection of diabetes, a diabetes specific insurance plan helps.


Hence, for a diabetes
patient, a diabetes specific insurance plan can address the hospitalisation
concerns better.


There is another reason that makes diabetes specific insurance plan important.


"Generally, health insurance plans treat diabetes as a pre-existing disease and
put a waiting period on the policy, which is around 12 months to 2 years, but
can sometimes go up to 4 years.


So it is sensible to buy a diabetes specific
plan which is way more comprehensive than the health plans and also covers
various complexities," says Naval Goel, Founder & CEO, PolicyX.com.


Costlier than others

Buying a diabetes health insurance plan can, however, be costlier than other
disease specific plans.


It could be because of the rising incidence, so insurers
perceive higher risk of payouts, and also because the plan is a specialised
product.


Life-long renewals beyond 65 years
are offered under all such plans.


Apollo Munich Health Insurance's 'Energy'

Apollo Munich Health Insurance offers 'Energy', a diabetes insurance plan for
those who have been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes or Prediabetes (Impaired
Fasting Glucose/Impaired Glucose Tolerance) or Hypertension.


The plan also provides coverage for 144 day-care procedures.


There is a wellness
programme inbuilt in the plan which takes care of wellness tests and wellness
support that includes online data sharing and a wellness coach to help manage
diet and health.


In addition, the plan offers a renewal premium discount of up to 25 per cent for
the management of health conditions.


Therefore, it's a kind of a
combo of Mediclaim and diabetes insurance plan.


The plan also covers out-patient
expenses for medical consultations, diagnostic tests, medicine and compensation
for the accidental death of the insured person.


Conclusion

As Ashish Mehrotra, MD & CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance, says, "A comprehensive
health insurance plan covers multiple conditions and removes the worry of
managing multiple plans.


If, however, diabetes is detected at a later stage, the future claim on the
plain-vanilla health insurance plan runs the risk of being jeopardised unless
the policyholder informs the insurer of any change in his medical condition.


"Diabetes plans provide much needed immediate and specialised covers for such a
serious disease.


It is, therefore, worth investing in specialised health
insurance plan for diabetes as a supplementary cover to your regular health
insurance plan," says Chopra.


It's realistic to expect some glitches, but online health insurance marketplaces
will increase options for those without coverage or small businesses with costly
plans today, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart said.

Elizabeth Williams)

That's when 50 state health care marketplaces (also called exchanges) will be
available online for small businesses and uninsured individuals to shop for
health care plans that meet 2014 insurance mandates under the Affordable Care
Act (ACA).


The marketplaces' function is to simply list the health plans offered by health
insurance companies that choose (and are qualified) to be in your state's
marketplace.


They'll also show each policy's premium based on the ages of those
covered, where you live, whether anyone smokes, and your income (to see if you
qualify for a tax credit or perhaps a premium subsidy).


In Iowa, six health insurance companies have submitted health plans to be listed
on its insurance marketplace, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart told DTN.


Remember, there are two strong advantages of going with a marketplace-offered
plan: (1) small business health care tax credits, and (2) individual health
insurance tax subsidies will only be available for coverage purchased through a
state health insurance marketplace/exchange.


The Affordable Care Act requires everyone to have a health insurance policy, but
it does not force you to buy from a plan offered on your state's marketplace,
and in some cases you won't have to change your policy at all.


In Iowa, "well over half our Farm Bureau members will not see any change in
their plans as they are in what are called 'grandfathered plans' -- meaning they
can stay in those plans," said Steve Kammeyer with Farm Bureau Financial
Services in West Des Moines, Iowa.


"The rest of our members will have the option
of staying on their existing plan for at least another year because Wellmark
(the health insurance provider for Iowa Farm Bureau) has been granted an
extension on their renewal period."


Most farm operations have fewer employees and they'll want to see how their
current insurance plan stacks up with those listed on their state's marketplace.


HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK

You plug in your personal information -- income level (to see if you qualify for
subsidized premium), your age, your address, whether you smoke, if you are
married and/or have children.


Businesses could band together to reduce their health insurance bills, while
workers would get "no frills" coverage if they lose their jobs, under a plan
proposed Wednesday by Gov.


Edgar's plan is less comprehensive than the national health-care reforms
proposed by President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, but the
governor said the state shouldn't wait for Congress to act.


Edgar stressed that his health-care plan, which he promised five weeks ago,
would not create a new bureaucracy to oversee health insurance nor cost
taxpayers any money.


Edgar's plan would create a voluntary system so businesses could join to buy
health insurance for their workers.


Edgar's plan, unlike the Clinton proposal, would not force businesses to provide
health insurance to anyone.


Under Edgar's plan, those workers could buy a "no-frills" policy
that would limit future employers from imposing new waiting periods for a
pre-existing ailment.

Mandan public schools will move to a fully-funded health insurance plan in
October.


Premiums will
go up 26 percent, and Blue Cross Blue Shield will decide the deductible instead
of the district, business manager Joe Lukach said.


Currently, the district has a self-funded health plan administered by Blue Cross
Blue Shield with a $1,000 deductible.


The plan, however, cannot sustain itself.


The health insurance committee compared the cost of a self-funded and fully
funded health plan in 2005-06, and the fully funded plan would have saved the
district money, board member Tim Tausend said.


The board also considered changes to the plans for the new middle school during
an update.

AG obtains $2.4M judgment

BYLINE: Bryan Cohen

LENGTH: 446 words


BOSTON (Legal Newsline) - Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley
announced a $2.4 million civil judgment Tuesday against two companies for
alleged fraudulent marketing and selling a discount health plan as health
insurance.


The judgment
permanently prohibits the defendants from representing a discount health plan or
insurance as enabling a state resident to meet the state health insurance
coverage mandate when the product does not meet the requisite standard,
marketing or selling as health insurance a product that is not a health benefit
plan and violating regulations issued by Coakley governing discount health plans
and discount health plan organizations.


It is particularly important that
companies offering discount health plans clearly disclose what their plans do
and do not offer," Coakley said.


"We will continue to vigorously pursue
companies if they misrepresent discount plans as health insurance in
Massachusetts."


According to a complaint filed in October 2009 against CHBA,
NBC, Guarantee Trust Life Insurance Company and Vantage America Solutions, Inc.,
the defendants allegedly engaged in deceptive and unfair sales of a discount
health plan to consumers using multiple tactics and represented the discount
health plan as health insurance and as sufficient to satisfy the state law
requiring individuals to have health insurance.


Discount health plans
claim to offer consumers discounts for specific health care services or products
from certain providers in exchange for some form of fee.


Under a discount health
plan, the plan member should receive a discount but is obligated to make all
payments for provided services.


Discount health plans are not themselves
insurance products and are not regulated by the Massachusetts Division of
Insurance, Coakley says.


These plans are not actually health insurance and do
not meet the requirement under state law to have health insurance.

Insurance Commissioner Advises Consumers to be Wary of Limited Benefit Plans,
Exercise Caution When Shopping for Health Insurance

LENGTH: 472  words

DATELINE: New York



 Harrisburg: Pennsylvania Department of Insurance has issued the following news
release:



   Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller today issued a consumer alert advising
consumers to be cautious and understand the policy before purchasing a health
insurance plan.


Health insurance plans can still be purchased "off-marketplace."


These plans
may advertise coverage at a lower rate, but they are not required to meet the
same coverage standards as marketplace plans and may provide a more limited
scope of benefits.


Websites like healthcare.com  may resemble the federal
marketplace, but these are off-marketplace plans and are not eligible for
subsidies.


In addition, these plans may not protect you from tax penalties for
not having minimum essential coverage.


Off-marketplace plans may advertise coverage at a lower rate than plans
available through the federal marketplace, but these plans do not always offer
the same level of coverage for routine medical visits, preventive care, and
diagnostic testing.


These plans are not required to provide coverage for
pre-existing conditions, meaning you may have to pay for services related to
pre-existing conditions out-of-pocket.


In addition, many of these plans have pre-designated reimbursement rates for
types of services.


Commissioner Miller urged consumers to consider the following questions when
shopping for a health insurance plan, including:



     Does the plan provide coverage for preventive, diagnostic, and other
routine services?


Are your doctors in the plan's provider network?


Does the plan meet minimum essential coverage requirements?


"If your health insurance plan does not meet minimum essential coverage
standards outlined in the Affordable Care Act, you may face a tax penalty," said
Commissioner Miller.


The Catamount Health Plan is a new health insurance plan designed to offer
comprehensive benefits with very low out-of-pocket co-pays and other expenses.


Catamount Health is intended for half of the state's estimated 65,000 uninsured
who don't qualify for other state-subsidized health insurance plans.


This plan
is a part of the State of Vermont's initiative to develop several programs to
improve the affordability of health insurance so that all Vermonters may have
access to coverage.

REP. RON MARIANO

The House of Representatives, under the leadership of Speaker Sal DiMasi, has
put forth an ambitious plan to provide health insurance for 95 percent of our
residents within three years.


This groundbreaking legislation significantly
expands coverage for the poor and encourages personal responsibility, by
requiring individuals to buy insurance if there is an affordable plan available
to them.


It is an attempt to bring individuals, business, and the state together
as partners in a comprehensive plan to solve the problem of the uninsured.


After much investigation, it is apparent that our Uncompensated Care Pool, the
funding mechanism by which we pay health care providers for services delivered
to the uninsured, is one of our most significant problems.


The House plan uses a tiered
approach to reduce the number of residents seeking care from the Uncompensated
Care Pool by proposing the following solutions: expand access to cover more
people in the most cost-effective manner; enable insurers to provide more
affordable products; and encourage responsible consumer behavior.


Under the
legislation, the state would provide health insurance to 100,000 low-income
children, parents, and other adults.


The House
plan would also use funds from the state's 1998 tobacco settlement to help pay
for new costs to the state.


The House plan attempts to spread the cost of health
care services for the uninsured to businesses that do not offer health insurance
and whose employees, in many cases, are receiving health services through the
free care pool, and also to individuals that have chosen not to participate in
the current system and who still use the free care pool.


The plan exempts very small
businesses that have 10 employees or less, as well as businesses that spend more
than 7 percent of their payroll on health insurance.


Adding a new requirement on
businesses and individuals without also making changes to our expensive health
insurance market would be unfair, which is why the House plan also takes steps
to make it easier and less expensive to buy health insurance.


The new Health
Insurance Connector will act as a one-stop shopping center, selling affordable,
pre-approved health plans to businesses and individuals alike.


By allowing the
Connector to sell a much wider range of health insurance plans than is currently
available, we give companies the ability to tailor their policies to the needs
of their employees.


The Connector reduces administrative burdens on small
businesses, facilitates portability of plans, and allows part-time and seasonal
workers to combine contributions from multiple employers.


For those lower-income individuals who do not
qualify for coverage under our expanded Medicaid program, and who are unable to
purchase health insurance on their own, the state will help pay the monthly
premiums on a sliding scale, but only to the extent that is absolutely
necessary.


By taking bold and
innovative steps, the House has created a comprehensive plan that should provide
health insurance coverage for 95 percent of Massachusetts residents within three
years.

Understand your health insurance

BYLINE: The Morgan Messenger staff

LENGTH: 520  words


If you've ever had to decide on a health insurance plan, you probably spent days
with stacks of paper all over the dining room table trying to sift through fine
print that seems like it's written in Latin.


Comparing plans is absurdly complicated.


Because of a new consumer protection
in the health reform law, insurance companies must clearly explain their
coverage plans and make them easy-to-under-stand.


You should be able to do
the same thing before choosing a health insurance plan.


It's now easier for
families to compare and understand plans and choose the one that best fits their
needs.


Now, health insurance companies must provide standard summaries of their
benefits and coverage so you can easily look at the differences between plans.


Your
health insurance plan will now have to provide you with a Coverage Facts label
so you can get a sense of the out-of-pocket costs you will have to pay for
routine medical care like office visits, lab tests, and prescription drugs as
well as for complex medical treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation
treatment.


And you will have a glossary of commonly used health care terms like
"deductible" and "co-payment" so you can track all the health care jargon.


Gone
are the days when you had to work to decipher what your health plans actually
cover and at what cost.


Health insurance
companies can no longer take advantage by charging more money for less service,
hiding behind loopholes and excuses to deny benefits you paid for, and making
plans overly complicated.


When you buy a plan or policy, you pay a monthly fee and in return, the
company agrees to pay part of your medical expenses when you get sick or hurt.


Westenhofer: While no one plans to get sick or hurt, most people need medical
care at some point.


Westenhofer: If you can afford health insurance coverage in 2015, but don't sign
up, you will have to pay a penalty ($325 per adult, $162.40 per child   up to
$975 per family or 2 percent of income whichever is higher).


Westenhofer: The list is long, but here are a few reasons why a person might be
exempt:

Coverage is unaffordable coverage (more than 8 percent of household income)

You are a member of federally recognized tribe

You are below tax filing threshold and not required to file taxes

You have been uninsured for less than three consecutive months during the year

DH: When can a person purchase health insurance?


You can only purchase insurance
outside of that time period if you have a qualifying life event, such as a
marriage, divorce, new baby, and change of income, to name a few.


You are considered covered if you have Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, any job-based
plan, any plan you've purchased yourself, COBRA, retiree coverage, Tricare, VA
health coverage.


Westenhofer: Each plan varies in terms of overall cost and depends on the amount
of premium and deductible you choose.


You may also have an
annual deductible.


For example, let's say you have a plan
with a $200 deductible.


You pay
the first $200 to cover the deductible, and then your insurance pays its share.


How much you pay for your premium and deductible depends on the type of
insurance you have and whether you're purchasing individual or family coverage.


DH: What types of plans are there?


Westenhofer: There are four levels of qualified health plans on the Health
Insurance Marketplace: platinum, gold, silver, and bronze.


Each category has a
different monthly premium costs, as well as deductible.


There are a lot of
affordable options on the Health Insurance Marketplace and you can compare each
plan side by side so you can find the plan that meets you and/or your family's
needs.


Westenhofer: The federal government can assist some individuals and families
with their premiums costs by providing subsidies to those who qualify based on
their income.


For example, if a family of four had an income of about $40,000 in
2014, they may be eligible for subsidy assistance on premium costs that exceed 5
percent of their income.


If that same family of four purchases a Silver plan
that might cost them around $9,400 per year, they could eligible to receive
subsidy assistance of up to almost $7,400; which means they would only be
responsible for about $2,000 of the insurance premium costs themselves.


And, equally important, parents can cover their children up to age 26 on their
insurance plan.


Westenhofer: The federal government has announced that for those consumers who
are already enrolled in a Marketplace plan in 2014, they will have an automatic
enrollment option to select the same health plan coverage in 2015.


Westenhofer: In addition to pre-existing conditions, all qualified health plans
must offer:

Ambulatory patient services

Hospitalization and emergency services

Maternity and newborn care

Mental Health and substance use disorder

Prescription drugs

Lab services

Preventive and wellness services

Chronic disease management

Pediatric services, including dental and vision care

Of course, you have to meet your deductible before insurance pays.


DH: I've also heard that qualified health plans cover preventive care services
at no charge.


Westenhofer: Yes, qualified plans cover many preventive care screenings, tests
and services such as vaccinations that can help adults and children stay
healthy.


And the best news is, they're free   no copays or deductibles.


For women, many preventive care screenings, tests and supplies that can help
with family planning and pregnancy are now covered, along with services such as
these:

Well-woman checkups

Contraceptives and birth control counseling

Screenings during pregnancy for a variety of conditions

Breastfeeding supplies, support and counseling

DH: Besides a health insurance plan on the Health Insurance Marketplace, what
other types of health insurance are available?


Westenhofer: Many families with limited income will qualify for Medicaid or
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and they can enroll any time of the
year.


Medicaid provides health coverage for some low-income people, families and
children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.


In some
states the program covers all low-income adults below a certain income level.

Consumers move to health cash plans but it's wise to check for side-effects

Shrinking pay packets have seen consumers switching to lower levels of health
cover and using the savings to take out health cash plans, writes CAROLINE
MADDEN

A COMBINATION of shrink- ing pay packets and higher premiums has forced many
households to cut back on private health insurance.


One trend emerging is that consumers are switching to lower levels of cover
or, more worryingly, dropping their private health insurance altogether   and
using the savings to take out cheap health cash plans.


Traditional private health insurance products are primarily designed to cover
in-patient  healthcare costs such as hospital stays and major operations,
whereas health cash plans focus on providing cash payments for routine
day-to-day  out-patient  expenses such as visits to GPs and other health
practitioners such as dentists and physiotherapists.


Cash plans can be an ideal
complement to private health insurance.


The main provider of health cash plans in Ireland is the Hospital Saturday Fund
(HSF) Health Plan (www.hsf.ie), and it currently covers just over 100,000 people
in the Republic.


HSF offers seven different plans, with premiums ranging from EUR 9.50 to EUR 55
a month, which translates into annual costs of between EUR 114 and EUR 660 a
year.


The top-of-the-range plan, known as Scheme 5500, pays for half of all dental and
optical care costs up to a maximum of EUR 550 a year.


One of the key advantages of the HSF cash plans is that their premiums are not
dependent on the number of people included on a policy.


They can, therefore,
prove extremely cost-effective for large families because a contributor can add
their spouse or partner, and all dependant children up to 18 to their plan at no
extra cost.


As a result, parents with several young children who are likely to
make frequent trips to the doctor s surgery and pharmacy could easily find that
their cash plan more than pays for itself each year.


Some private health insurance plans provide a certain level of out-patient
cover, for example reimbursing a certain level of GP, consultant or
physiotherapy fees, in addition to hospital cover.


In the case of Hibernian Aviva Health s  we plan  health insurance policy, an
out-patient excess of EUR 250 applies per family.


However, if a family has supplemented their
health insurance with a cash plan it will go some way towards covering the costs
that they are unable to claim on their health insurance.


Several health insurers offer  day-to-day  health insurance products which can
be bought as standalone products, or as add-ons to the consumer s main hospital
plan.


One advantage of this type of product is that premiums qualify for tax relief at
20 per cent (as is the case with all private health insurance premiums), whereas
contributions to health cash plans do not qualify for any such relief.


Despite this, day-to-day plans aren t necessarily better value than cash plans,
and it s important to weigh up the benefits, and the level of cover offered,
before making a decision.


For example, both types of plans (health cash plans and  day-to-day  health
insurance products) generally cover dental, optical and GP costs, but the number
of visits and the maximum amounts that can be claimed vary widely.


Furthermore, some of the more advanced HSF health cash plans offer extra
benefits such as personal injury cover, and all of their plans pay grants for
hospital stays, so consumers should assess their family s specific medical
requirements before choosing the product that best suits them.


A cash plan can help to bridge the gap between the total costs arising from
hospital stays, and what the patient s private health insurance will pay out.


Ideally, health cash plans should be used to supplement private health insurance
rather than replace it.


Although they can help to alleviate the burden of everyday medical costs, for
families in particular, health cash plans are not designed to cover the  big
ticket  health costs such as major surgery or hospital bills.


Despite this major drawback, more people are eschewing expensive private health
insurance in favour of low-cost cash plans   because it s all they can afford.


Although health cash plans may be enticingly cheap, and are better than having
no health cover at all, consumers must make sure they fully understand the
limitations of these products before signing up.

Health Insurance Exchange

Sept. 13--PINEHURST -- Citing "uncertainties," a Moore County insurance company
on Thursday canceled its plans to offer health insurance to the general public
through President Obama's health care reform program.


This leaves the state with only two insurance providers who have said they will
sell policies through the government's Health Insurance Marketplace when it goes
online on Oct. 1.


It planned to offer 16 insurance plans
through the Marketplace to people in Moore, Richmond, Montgomery, Hoke,
Scotland, and Lee counties.


Non-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina announced plans to sell
policies through the Marketplace statewide.


Published reports say Coventry
Health Care of the Carolinas also plans to offer coverage, but details have not
been announced.

NCQA Releases 2016 Health Insurance Plan Ratings

LENGTH: 630  words


Oct. 3 -- National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) announces its 2016
Health Insurance Plan Ratings.


These ratings provide consumers with a more
accurate picture of how health insurance plans perform in the key quality areas
of consumer satisfaction, prevention and treatment.


NCQA's Health Insurance Plan Ratings 2016-2017 compare the quality and services
of more than 1,000 health plans in the United States.


WebMD is the leading provider of health information services and tools, serving
consumers, physicians, healthcare professionals, employers and health plans.


"Now, more people who are
engaged and interested in their health care will have access to these ratings,
enabling them to make more informed decisions about which health plans are best
suited for their needs.


This is an important step in making health plan
information more accessible to wider audiences."


About the Ratings:

NCQA studied 1,401 health plans and rated 1,012: 503 private (commercial), 338
Medicare and 171 Medicaid.


The ratings are a system similar to CMS Star Ratings of Medicare Advantage
plans, and give unprecedented importance to health outcomes and consumer
satisfaction.


Key Takeaways from the 2016-2017 Ratings Include:

* New England and Great Lakes Plans Perform Best: States with the highest
percentage of plans receiving a 4.5 or 5.0 out of 5 rating include
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Maine, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Vermont
and New York.


* High and Low Performers Are Rare: Of the 1,012 rated plans, 105 (10%) received
a top rating of 4.5 or 5.0 out of 5.


Most plans are in the middle, approximating a "bell curve" when all
plans' performances are plotted on a graph.


http://bit.ly/2cHgZV2

* Commonalities among plans: The percent of top-rated plans are relatively the
same between Private (Commercial), Medicare and Medicaid plans.


* Consumer Satisfaction: What patients say about their health plans in
satisfaction surveys, including care, customer service and physicians.


* Prevention: How well plans provide screenings, immunizations and other
preventive services.


* Treatment: How well a plan performs in treating chronic and acute conditions
such as diabetes, depression and heart disease.


The study also
finds that employer satisfaction with health plans can vary depending on how
they work with their broker.


The study contrasts the esteem that
employers hold for their health plan, based on whether they used brokers merely
to shop for coverage or as an ongoing partner in their dealings with health
plans.


* The collaborative model consists of ongoing joint communications that engage
the broker, the employer and the health plan in a team approach.


An employer appears more satisfied with its health plan when a broker becomes
integrated within communications that occur between them.


The broker's role is to assure open and
transparent dialogue, not simply to function as an agent of the health plan.

Colleges and universities across the country increasingly are mandating that
students have health insurance, or either be dismissed or automatically enrolled
in a plan through registration.


Officials with the five area colleges and universities said another reason for
mandatory health plans is that the more students to enroll, the cheaper the
rate.


For uninsured students who cannot afford a school's plan,
officials handle things on a caseby-case basis.


At Central State, students are automatically entered into a health plan upon
enrollment, regardless of whether they're already insured.


Wright State and the UD both require resident students to have health insurance,
but also permit those students to be covered under their parent's or employer's
plan.


At WSU, Ross said students may purchase a plan through the university, and
verification of coverage is checked quarterly.


UD students are expected to be on a health plan, but the university does not
require proof of health insurance, said Steven Mueller, UD assistant vice
president for health and wellness.


He said the school does, however, routinely
issue reminders to students to enroll in a plan.


And while commuter students are not required to be on a health plan, many sign
up, said Ross.


"It's relatively affordable, or some buy it to complement their existing plan,"
she said.


Students there are automatically charged for the university's health insurance,
but also may obtain an outside plan, she said.


Kettering College of Medical Arts provides health insurance
referral information to students not under a plan.


In her session, Rodehorst will also draw on Connecture's keen understanding of
how carriers do business and its track record of providing the customized
infrastructure needed to effectively sell and administer the nation's most
successful health insurance plans.


"This session will provide attendees with a clear
understanding of what's required to get their plans certified, offered in health
insurance exchanges and ultimately purchased by consumers in a positive buying
experience."


Some of the key questions the session will address - attendees will gain
information they can use right now - include:

* What do I need to know about how plans will be managed on and certified by
exchanges?


* What standards must be addressed to ensure certification as a qualified health
plan?


* What does the implementation timeline for plan management and certification
look like, what steps must carriers take, and how might the timeline vary from
exchange to exchange?


* What are the most pressing challenges carriers face when it comes to plan
management and what can they do to overcome them?

Peter Orszag: The coming shift to defined-contribution health insurance

BYLINE: By Peter Orszag

SECTION: OPINION; Columnists

LENGTH: 878 words


Over the next decade, we are likely to see a shift in health insurance in the
U.S.: So-called defined-contribution plans will gradually take over the market,
shifting the residual risk of incurring high health-care costs from employers to
workers.


The market today is dominated by "defined-benefit" plans, under which companies
determine a set of health-insurance benefits that are provided for employees.


These will gradually be replaced by defined-contribution plans, under which
companies pay a fixed amount, and employees use the money to buy or help pay for
insurance they choose themselves.


Over the past two decades, company retirement
programs have moved decisively away from defined-benefit plans, in which workers
are paid a given amount of retirement income, and toward defined-contribution
401(k) plans, in which risks - from fluctuating financial markets, for example -
are borne by workers.


In 1985, a total of 89 of the Fortune 100 companies offered their new hires a
traditional defined-benefit pension plan, and just 10 of them offered only a
defined-contribution plan.


Today, only 13 of the Fortune 100 companies offer a
traditional defined-benefit plan, and 70 offer only a defined-contribution plan.


The movement toward defined-contribution plans for health insurance is, in some
ways, similar to the one that occurred for pensions, as Kenneth L. Sperling and
Oren M. Shapira explained in an article earlier this year.


The pension shift
occurred in a series of stages: First, the traditional defined-benefit plan was
redesigned.


Then a hybrid approach was introduced (the cash- balance plan).


Finally, defined-benefit plans were frozen.


In the early 1990s, in response to accounting changes and rising
costs, companies began to re-evaluate retiree health plans, and some capped the
amount they were willing to pay at a multiple of existing costs.


Over time, as
those limits were reached, most companies declined to raise them, thereby
effectively creating defined-contribution retiree health-insurance plans, with
the company's contribution set by the cap.


For current workers, the precursor to a defined-contribution approach is the
"consumer-driven" health plan.


This typically has higher deductibles and
co-payments than a traditional plan has, and it is often tied to a health
savings account.


The share of workers enrolled in such plans remains quite low but is expanding
rapidly.


A recent survey of large companies found that, in 2012, almost
three-quarters will offer consumer-driven health-insurance plans.


Indeed, the legislation may
have a larger impact on the type of health-insurance plan that employers offer
than on their decision about whether to drop health-care benefits altogether.


If most employers do retain their health plans, the state insurance exchanges
created under the new federal health-care law will make the basic idea of a
defined-contribution health plan more prevalent, and thus may speed its
adoption.


If defined-contribution plans that are sufficiently generous count as
employer-based coverage - as is generally expected - the trend toward such plans
will probably accelerate.


In any case, the bottom line is that a shift toward defined-contribution plans
seems likely.


I'd be willing to bet $1 that most large U.S. employer health-care
offerings in 2020 will be defined-contribution plans.


The company offers a range of health insurance
products and services across the US catering to the requirements of individuals,
families, children and self employed.


Health insurance solutions offered by the company include low cost individual
health insurance products for people of different age group, family health
insurance products, children's health plans and insurance for self employed
people.


Individual health insurance plans offered by the company include economical
basic health coverage plan (Celtic Basic), comprehensive health plan (CeltiCare,
CeltiCare II and CeltiCare Preferred), health savings account (HAS) qualified
health plan (CelticSaver HSA), short term medical insurance (Celtic Short-Term)
and student health insurance (Celtic PostGrad).


Medical insurance products offered by the company include stand-alone
guarantee-issue medical conversion program to the self-funded employer groups,
stop-loss and fully-insured group carriers, managed care plans, and HMO
reinsurers across the 49 states in the US.


The company also offers services such
as locate a doctor or hospital wherein it contracts with Preferred Provider
Organizations (PPOs) to make use of their network of health care providers and
hospitals for its PPO health benefit plans.

HSA usage up in plans withhigh deductible

BYLINE: JERRY GEISEL

SECTION: NEWS; Pg.

LENGTH: 275 words


Enrollment in health savings accounts linked to high-deductible health insurance
plans surged to 10 million people as of Jan. 1, a 25% increase in a year,
according to an annual census released last week.


The key factor driving HSA growth is that premiums for high-deductible health
insurance plans, to which HSAs must be linked by law, tend to be lower than more
traditional health plans.


This year, the minimum deductible for single coverage through an HSA-linked
health plan is $1,200.


The minimum deductible for family coverage is $2,400.


The America's Health Insurance Plans census is based on 93 insurers and their
subsidiaries offering HSA-linked health insurance plans.


The organization said
it believes its census covers almost all people enrolled in plans linked to
HSAs.


When you buy a plan or policy, you pay a monthly fee and in return, the
company agrees to pay part of your medical expenses when you get sick or hurt.


Westenhofer: While no one plans to get sick or hurt, most people need medical
care at some point.


Westenhofer: If you can afford health insurance coverage in 2015, but don't sign
up, you will have to pay a penalty ($325 per adult, $162.40 per child   up to
$975 per family or 2% of income whichever is higher).


Westenhofer: The list is long, but here are a few reasons why a person might be
exempt:

Coverage is unaffordable coverage (more than 8% of household income)

You are a member of federally recognized tribe

You are below tax filing threshold and not required to file taxes

You have been uninsured for less than three consecutive months during the year

DH: When can a person purchase health insurance?


You can only purchase insurance
outside of that time period if you have a qualifying life event, such as a
marriage, divorce, new baby, and change of income, to name a few.


You are considered covered if you have Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, any job-based
plan, any plan you've purchased yourself, COBRA, retiree coverage, Tricare, VA
health coverage.


Westenhofer: Each plan varies in terms of overall cost and depends on the amount
of premium and deductible you choose.


You may also have an
annual deductible.


For example, let's say you have a plan with a $200 deductible.


You pay the first $200 to cover the
deductible, and then your insurance pays its share.


How much you pay for your
premium and deductible depends on the type of insurance you have and whether
you're purchasing individual or family coverage.


DH: What types of plans are there?


Westenhofer: There are four levels of qualified health plans on the Health
Insurance Marketplace: platinum, gold, silver, and bronze.


Each category has a
different monthly premium costs, as well as deductible.


There are a lot of
affordable options on the Health Insurance Marketplace and you can compare each
plan side by side so you can find the plan that meets you and/or your family's
needs.


Westenhofer: The federal government can assist some individuals and families
with their premiums costs by providing subsidies to those who qualify based on
their income.


For example, if a family of four had an income of about $40,000 in 2014, they
may be eligible for subsidy assistance on premium costs that exceed 5 percent of
their income.


If that same family of four purchases a Silver plan that might
cost them around $9,400 per year, they could eligible to receive subsidy
assistance of up to almost $7,400; which means they would only be responsible
for about $2,000 of the insurance premium costs themselves.


And, equally important, parents can cover their children up to age 26 on their
insurance plan.


Westenhofer: The federal government has announced that for those consumers who
are already enrolled in a Marketplace plan in 2014, they will have an automatic
enrollment option to select the same health plan coverage in 2015.


Westenhofer: In addition to pre-existing conditions, all qualified health plans
must offer:

Ambulatory patient services

Hospitalization and emergency services

Maternity and newborn care

Mental Health and substance use disorder

Prescription drugs

Lab services

Preventive and wellness services

Chronic disease management

Pediatric services, including dental and vision care

Of course, you have to meet your deductible before insurance pays.


DH: I've also heard that qualified health plans cover preventive care services
at no charge.


Westenhofer: Yes, qualified plans cover many preventive care screenings, tests
and services such as vaccinations that can help adults and children stay
healthy.


And the best news is, they're free   no copays or deductibles.


For women, many preventive care screenings, tests and supplies that can help
with family planning and pregnancy are now covered, along with services such as
these:

Well-woman checkups

Contraceptives and birth control counseling

Screenings during pregnancy for a variety of conditions

Breastfeeding supplies, support and counseling

DH: Besides a health insurance plan on the Health Insurance Marketplace, what
other types of health insurance are available?


Westenhofer: Many families with limited income will qualify for Medicaid or
Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, and they can enroll any time of the
year.


Medicaid provides health coverage for some low-income people, families and
children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.


In some
states the program covers all low-income adults below a certain income level.

New York: New Student Health Insurance Plan and Policy Introduced

LENGTH: 824  words

DATELINE: Albany


Syracuse University, The State of New York has issued the following News
release:

In accordance with the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010 (ACA), Syracuse University will be offering a new student health insurance
plan as of Aug. 1.


The plan offering coincides with a revised University
policy--to be phased in over the next two years--requiring that all full-time
students carry some form of ACA-compliant health insurance.


The decision, based on the recommendations of the University's Student Health
Insurance Advisory Committee, is designed to ensure students have the health
coverage vital to their well-being and to meet the requirements of the new
health care reforms.


"Our current health insurance plan was unsustainable as it was," says Senior
Vice President and Dean of Student Affairs Rebecca Reed Kantrowitz.


"To provide
all students with access to an affordable, ACA-compliant plan, we needed to
assess different options to ensure no student was left underinsured and at risk
of jeopardizing their education or financial stability.


Starting August 1, the plan will be available to all students.


Those students
will be required to demonstrate proof of appropriate existing coverage prior to
registration for classes or adopt the student health insurance plan through
Aetna Student Health.


The premium for this improved plan is less than $2,000 a
year--a significant reduction from what's currently available through the
federal government's health exchange marketplace, as well as the University's
current plan, which is being discontinued.


This can include insurance provided through a parent's
family plan, through an employer, health care exchange or other source.


Those
without qualifying coverage will be required to enroll in the University's
student health insurance plan.


To assist students with these changes and to provide more details on the new
student health insurance plan and proof of insurance requirement, informational
sessions are scheduled for Tuesday, April 14, from 6-7 p.m. and Wednesday, April
15, from 5:30-6:30 p.m. in Grant Auditorium.


The
report shows that monthly premiums for plans selected on eHealth.com by
unsubsidized shoppers averaged $378 for individuals and $997 for families of two
or more.


Average premiums for individual health insurance plans
selected by eHealth shoppers have increased 39% since the 2014 open enrollment
period, when major provisions of the Affordable

Care Act first came into effect.


Average
premiums for family plans have increased 49% since the 2014 open enrollment
period, when major provisions of the Affordable Care Act first came into effect.


Annual
deductibles for individual plans increased 2% compared to the 2016 open
enrollment period while deductibles for family plans increased 3%.


The average monthly premium for a four-person family was $1,195 per
month, and the average annual deductible for a four-person family was $8,044.


* HMO-style plans now account for more than half of all plans selected by
shoppers.


The percentage of eHealth shoppers selecting HMO-style plans increased
from 39% for 2014 to 53% for 2017; meanwhile the number of shoppers selecting
PPO-style plans has decreased from 46% for 2014 to 22% for 2017.


* The popularity of silver plans increases.


Silver plans accounted for 33% of
all plans selected by eHealth shoppers for 2017 compared to 21% for 2014;
meanwhile, the percentage of bronze plans selected by shoppers has dropped from
47% in 2014 to 43% in 2017.


"Among unsubsidized eHealth shoppers, the average family of four will
spend more than $14,300 on premiums this year, and you can add another $8,000 if
medical issues require them to fulfill their annual deductible.


Mr Flanders continued: "Middle-income Americans who purchase coverage on their
own and do not qualify for subsidies under current law are straining under the
burden of costs like these.


At eHealth we hear from them every day, and we work
hard to match them with the best health plan available for their needs and
budget.


Findings from the current report are derived from an analysis of plans selected
by more than 38,000 individual and family health insurance shoppers at
eHealth.com during the 2017 open enrollment period (November 1, 2016 - January
31, 2017).


This report does not offer a comprehensive view of costs for all plans available
through eHealth, through the market as a whole, or through government exchanges.


Specific health insurance plan premiums,
deductibles, and other features may differ significantly from any averages or
other presented statistics.


The Catamount Health Plan is a new health insurance plan designed to offer
comprehensive benefits with very low out-of-pocket co-pays and other expenses.


Catamount Health is intended for half of the state's estimated 65,000 uninsured
who don't qualify for other state-subsidized health insurance plans.


This plan
is a part of the State of Vermont's initiative to develop several programs to
improve the affordability of health insurance so that all Vermonters may have
access to coverage.


Two types
of health insurance plans participate in the FEHB Program, Fee-for-Service (FFS)
plans and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO).


Health Insurance 1 administers the Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Service Benefit contract; Health Insurance 2 administers the remaining
FFS plan contracts and experience-rated HMO plan contracts; and Health Insurance
3 administers the community-rated HMO plan contracts.


Each health plan under the FEHB Program contracts with OPM to provide certain
health benefits to all members enrolled in its participating plan.


Under the
terms of the contract, members are entitled to pursue claims disputes by
following a formal dispute resolution process described in the plan's brochure.


After giving the plan the opportunity to reconsider its decision, members may
request OPM to review the plan's denial of benefits or benefit limitation.

Pay as you go  health insurance on the way to prevent people abandoning their
cover

SECTION: IRELAND

LENGTH: 481 words


GloHealth chief executive Jim Dowdall said  GloHealth Activate    which has two
different cash and two different hospital options   was the first  radical  plan
on offer in Ireland to tackle the  affordability issue  which has resulted in
tens of thousands of people dropping their health cover in recent years.


The
plans provide for cash back for scans, tests and other diagnoses, including
consultant visits and also grants access to GloHealth s 24-hour Nurse Line and
cash back for every night spent in hospital, from  33 per adult per month.


Almost 300,000 people have dropped their
health insurance since the end of 2008, with the most recent figures from the
Health Insurance Authority (HIA) showing that just over two million people were
insured with inpatient health insurance plans at the end of March this year
down 21,000 over the quarter and 47,000 over the course of a year.


Rising
premiums have been blamed for the exodus, and Health Minister Leo Varadkar has
already signalled that the Government s long-mooted universal health insurance
plan will not be in place by the intended 2019 deadline.


GloHealth said its new
Activate plans   available from September 1   would provide cover and allow
people to save money.


Under two plans, called Activate Cash and Activate More
Cash, customers can choose the cash plan based on how much they want to pay and
how much cash back they would like to receive for each benefit.


The Activate
Hospital plans also have two different components, Activate Hospital and
Activate More Hospital.


People can upgrade from the corresponding Activate Cash
plans at any time and GloHealth said it would reduce the upgrade waiting period
by two years for pre-existing conditions.


The price plans are graded from adult down to newborns.


The insurer
estimated that a family of two adults and two children could save  527.26 under
its Activate Cash plan over the course of a year, compared with a basic plan,
and that a similar family could save  676.64 with its Activate More Cash plan,
compared with the Better Choice Plan.


Jim Dowdall said the plans and pricing
structure could appeal to  tens of thousands of people   It will help stem the
tide of people who are falling out of the market and encourage others to come
back,  he said.

Answers to questions on health care plan;
As health exchange opens today, here are some explanations

BYLINE: Brandon Merritt

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg.


While Obamacare did create an individual mandate that requires almost
everyone to have health insurance coverage, it did not create a single
government insurance plan nor does it require anyone to purchase a specific
plan.


Obamacare, aka the Affordable Care Act (ACA), expands Medicaid for low-income
working age adults and creates an online "Marketplace" where people can shop for
private health insurance plans.


If your income is
below 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($94,200 for a family of four)
you may also qualify for tax subsidies that reduce your monthly insurance costs.


October 1st is the day that "open enrollment" begins, meaning that the
Marketplace will officially be up and running so people can compare and purchase
a plan or enroll in Medicaid if income eligible.


Coverage for these plans begins Jan. 1, 2014, and enrollment will run through
March 31.


In fact, it is illegal
for anyone to sell you a plan under Obamacare.


Plans purchased on the Marketplace are just like regular private plans and
doctors or clinics won't treat them any differently.


However, just like a typical private plan today, not all doctors will accept
every plan.


If being able to see a certain doctor is important to you, you will
be able to verify if they are "in-network" before you purchase your plan.


In short, Obamacare is subsidized private insurance plans and expanded Medicaid
for low-income households.


The additional regulations protect consumers by ensuring that health insurers
offer plans that meet minimum requirements like primary care, prevent insurers
from charging you more due to gender or previous illnesses, and prohibit
insurers from setting annual or lifetime limits on the care you receive.

Calhoun County employees to pay more for their health insurance

BYLINE: Laura Johnson, The Anniston Star, Ala.


The increase will add up to $10 per month for employees on the county's family
plan and $4.68 for employees on individual plans.


Calhoun County subscribes to a self-insurance plan, supplying health insurance
with funds it receives from employees.


That is different from fully insured
plans in which employers outsource health insurance coverage to a health
insurance company.


Employers who offer self-insurance plans are typically able to provide lower
premiums to employees and have more control over how the plan is administered
than do major insurance companies, said Michael O'Malley, executive director of
the Alabama Association of Health Plans.


Even with the increase, the county employees' insurance plans are lower than the
national average.


According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average cost of
a family health insurance plan in America is $15,745.


The cost for a family health insurance plan for a Calhoun County employee is
$7,111.44.


In 2002 the average cost of an insurance plan
for a single worker would have been $3,083.


The average cost of insurance for a family plan was $8,003 ten years ago.


County employees pay 40 percent of the annual cost, while the county pays 60
percent of the annual cost of its health insurance plans.


When you buy a plan or policy, you pay a monthly fee and in return, the
company agrees to pay part of your medical expenses when you get sick or hurt.


Westenhofer: While no one plans to get sick or hurt, most people need medical
care at some point.


Westenhofer: If you can afford health insurance coverage in 2015, but don't sign
up, you will have to pay a penalty ($325 per adult, $162.40 per child -- up to
$975 per family or 2 percent of income whichever is higher).


Westenhofer: The list is long, but here are a few reasons why a person might be
exempt:

o Coverage is unaffordable coverage (more than 8 percent of household income)

o You are a member of federally recognized tribe

o You are below tax filing threshold and not required to file taxes

o You have been uninsured for less than three consecutive months during the year

DH: When can a person purchase health insurance?


You can only purchase insurance
outside of that time period if you have a qualifying life event, such as a
marriage, divorce, new baby, and change of income, to name a few.


You are considered covered if you have Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, any job-based
plan, any plan you've purchased yourself, COBRA, retiree coverage, Tricare, VA
health coverage.


Westenhofer: Each plan varies in terms of overall cost and depends on the amount
of premium and deductible you choose.


You may also have an
annual deductible.


For example, let's say you have a plan
with a $200 deductible.


You pay
the first $200 to cover the deductible, and then your insurance pays its share.


How much you pay for your premium and deductible depends on the type of
insurance you have and whether you're purchasing individual or family coverage.


DH: What types of plans are there?


Westenhofer: There are four levels of qualified health plans on the Health
Insurance Marketplace: platinum, gold, silver, and bronze.


Each category has a
different monthly premium costs, as well as deductible.


There are a lot of
affordable options on the Health Insurance Marketplace and you can compare each
plan side by side so you can find the plan that meets you and/or your family's
needs.


Westenhofer: The federal government can assist some individuals and families
with their premiums costs by providing subsidies to those who qualify based on
their income.


For example, if a family of four had an income of about $40,000 in
2014, they may be eligible for subsidy assistance on premium costs that exceed 5
percent of their income.


If that same family of four purchases a Silver plan
that might cost them around $9,400 per year, they could eligible to receive
subsidy assistance of up to almost $7,400; which means they would only be
responsible for about $2,000 of the insurance premium costs themselves.


And, equally important, parents can cover their children up to age 26 on their
insurance plan.


Westenhofer: The federal government has announced that for those consumers who
are already enrolled in a Marketplace plan in 2014, they will have an automatic
enrollment option to select the same health plan coverage in 2015.


Westenhofer: In addition to pre-existing conditions, all qualified health plans
must offer:

o Ambulatory patient services

o Hospitalization and emergency services

o Maternity and newborn care

o Mental Health and substance use disorder

o Prescription drugs

o Lab services

o Preventive and wellness services

o Chronic disease management

o Pediatric services, including dental and vision care

Of course, you have to meet your deductible before insurance pays.


DH: I've also heard that qualified health plans cover preventive care services
at no charge.


Westenhofer: Yes, qualified plans cover many preventive care screenings, tests
and services such as vaccinations that can help adults and children stay
healthy.


And the best news is, they're free -- no copays or deductibles.


For women, many preventive care screenings, tests and supplies that can help
with family planning and pregnancy are now covered, along with services such as
these:

o Well-woman checkups

o Contraceptives and birth control counseling

o Screenings during pregnancy for a variety of conditions

o Breastfeeding supplies, support and counseling

DH: Besides a health insurance plan on the Health Insurance Marketplace, what
other types of health insurance are available?


Westenhofer: Many families with limited income will qualify for Medicaid or
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and they can enroll any time of the
year.


Medicaid provides health coverage for some low-income people, families and
children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.


In some
states the program covers all low-income adults below a certain income level.


In one month, nearly 400 children have enrolled in Geisinger Health Plan, the
newest of 10 health care plans across the state that cover children enrolled in
CHIP, said Kristen Wolf, outreach and marketing division chief for CHIP and
AdultBasic, at a press conference Thursday at Little People Day Care Center in
Kingston.


For more information about applying for CHIP, visit www.chipcover spakids.com or
www.chip.thehealth plan.com or call 866-621-5235.


On Thursday, the administration said more than 120 health-care plans had applied
to sell in the 19 state insurance exchanges that the government will run.


"I would characterize it as modest plan competition," Caroline Pearson, vice
president for health reform at Avalere Health, said.


But
we're certainly not seeing a wild influx of plans into the market."


Starting in October, each state will have a new insurance marketplace - an
Expedia-like Web site where residents can comparison-shop for health-insurance
plans.


Low- and middle-income Americans may qualify for a tax credit to cover a
portion of their premiums.


The federal government is also in the process of reviewing health insurers'
applications to run multi-state plans that would, in 2014, sell insurance plans
in at least 31 states.


The
White House readily admits that what matters isn't only how many plans there are
in a state but also how effectively they compete with one another to bring down
costs and increase quality.


Right now, it's not unusual for one health-insurance plan to cover the majority
of an individual market's buyers even when there are dozens of smaller health
plans in the same market.


"You need to have to have a lot of systems in place to
be an insurance company, like a provider network, and be able to compete against
a known brand."


The new health-insurance exchanges, Levitt said, will help smaller insurers gain
market share by displaying all insurance plans side by side, sorted by the cost
of monthly premiums.


"It definitely makes it easier for a small plan to compete," he said.


In California, for example, four of the 13 plans selling on the exchange are new
entrants to the insurance market.


Large health-insurance plans, meanwhile, have been relatively cautious in
participating in the new marketplaces.


UnitedHealth, the
country's largest health carrier, intends to sell plans in 10 to 25 new markets.


"A lot of people are worried," said Robert Laszewski, a former insurance
executive who now consults with health plans.


Some small health-insurance plans appear ready to sit out the new marketplace.


The two presidential
candidates approach health-care reform from opposite directions -- and there is
no telling how many taxpayer billions each candidate's plan might cost.


The most dramatic component of McCain's plan is the elimination of the favorable
tax treatment for employer-based health plans.


The government would tax
contributions to employer-based plans and then offer refundable tax credits (up
to $2,500 individuals, up to $5,000 families) to allow all Americans to purchase
private plans.


The Obama plan draws heavily from the Massachusetts health care
reform law of 2006, a plan which is still too early along to appraise
adequately, most experts say.


"Very different plans, very different objectives," says A. James Lee, a UMass
Lowell associate professor who specializes in health-care economics, in sizing
up the candidates' plans.


John McCain is more focused on
restructuring the health-insurance marketplace ... and it's less clear whether
or not his plan will significantly address the lack of insurance coverage."


"If you were starting from scratch, McCain's would probably be the best
approach," says Merrill Matthews, director of the Council For Affordable Health
Insurance, a research and advocacy association of insurance carriers in
Alexandria, Va.

"But, my goodness, (McCain's plan) creates so many upheavals in the current
system," Matthews adds.


Under the McCain plan "most uninsured Americans would probably remain
uninsured," according to Jonathan Oberlander, in the Aug. 21 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.


Oberlander, an associate professor of social
medicine and of health policy and administration at the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill, wrote also "the Obama plan would substantially expand
access to insurance, (but) it lacks reliable cost-control mechanisms and a
viable financing source."


The McCain plan is less specific about costs, relying on cost
containment and increased competition within the health-insurance industry to
drive down costs.


Matthews says Obama's plan is "conceivably workable," though does little to
address the greater issue of containing spiraling health-care costs.


As Matthews sees it, the biggest flaw in Obama's plan as proposed is the lack of
a mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance.


The insurance pool otherwise will be too small to make plans with reasonable
deductibles affordable, Matthews feels.


A report by
the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated employer-sponsored health insurance now
costs $12,680 annually for a family plan, with employees on average paying
$3,354 of that cost -- often for plans requiring far higher out-of-pocket costs
than previously.


The common thread Lee sees in both candidates' plans is an eventual shifting
away from employer-based insurance plans.


"With the Barack Obama plan ... the
(public-plan) alternatives that would be created could be sufficiently
attractive, as far as the funding structure, that employers would discontinue
offering health insurance."


The nearly $500
billion annual bill for Medicare already exceeds what the plan that covers
Americans 65-and-over receives in taxes, and the baby-boomer tidal wave is about
to hit.

Land of Lincoln Health: Illinois' Only CO-OP Health Insurance Company Launches
on the State's New Health Insurance Marketplace

LENGTH: 482  words


New Delhi, Oct. 1 -- Land of Lincoln Health, the first and only consumer
operated and oriented health insurance plan (CO-OP) in Illinois, is offering 35
health insurance plans on the State of Illinois' health insurance marketplace,
Get Covered Illinois.


Its network includes some of the highest-rated physicians
and hospitals across the state, and plans include out-of-state coverage for its
members.


Additionally, Land of Lincoln Health's plans were developed with total
cost in mind, considering not just the monthly cost to the member but the cost
of the yearly deductible, and other out of pocket costs.


"We used feedback from Illinois residents to inform the design of our plans,
making them clear, simple and affordable," said Daniel Yunker, CEO of Land of
Lincoln Health.


We are Illinois' health insurance provider for the people, by the people."


"It is good for
Illinois residents and businesses to have a new and different health insurance
provider that is driven by what is best for their members."

Highlights of the health plans

Overall approach

McCain believes in a free-market strategy designed to increase a person's choice
of health plans and break the tie between work and health insurance.


How plans would work

McCain would:

*Have no mandate on people to have health insurance and no requirement for
employers to provide insurance.


*Tax health benefits as income for first time.


*Eliminate state regulation of health insurance and allow people to cross state
lines to buy any insurance plan they want.


*Establish government access plan for the uninsurable.


*Require large companies to either provide health insurance for workers or pay a
percentage of payroll into a public plan.


*Expand Medicaid for very low-income people.


*Create a "national plan" for small businesses and people without
employer-provided insurance.


*Maintain state insurance regulation and require plans to cover pre-existing
conditions.


What the plans would cost

That depends whom you ask.


The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which both
campaigns has said is a credible analyst, estimates that McCain's plan would
cost the government $1.3 trillion over 10 years and the Obama plan $1.6
trillion.


The Lewin Group, a consulting firm well respected for its health analyses, says
McCain's plan would cost $2.05 trillion over a decade and Obama's would cost
$1.17 trillion.


How the plans would be paid for

Neither candidate has offered many specifics here.


McCain would rely most on the market aspects of his plan to drive down costs
once insurers have to compete for consumers who are shopping around for the best
plan.


Obama says he would use money saved by allowing the Bush tax cuts on those with
incomes over $250,000 a year to lapse.


He specializes in areas such
as executive compensation, retirement plans, employee benefits, and tax and
estate planning for these kinds of benefits.


The world of employee benefit plans is full of challenges and opportunities for
in-house counsel.


Retirement plans are valuable to employees at many levels of a business.


ERISA,
the federal law relating to retirement plans, is amended on a regular basis, and
proposals for further amendments are made almost weekly.


As members of the baby
boom generation approach the age of retirement, there will be more pressure on
employers to increase retirement income.


There are also questions about
appropriate costs associated with retirement plans.


Another method of dealing with cost is to add or increase co-pays and
deductibles.


Employers usually have the option of changing co-pays and
deductibles each year, and of asking their carrier or their health insurance
consultant the effect of such changes on the premium cost.


Co-pays and
deductibles can encourage employees to be careful consumers of health benefits,
but there is a risk of employees not getting health care that they really need,
and a risk of creating bad feelings.


The use of health insurance consultants, as
compared to dealing directly with insurers, often makes the process of choosing
a health plan provider and the terms of the plan more effective.


The process of
choosing health insurance providers and options has become too complicated for
individual employers to make the necessary choices without third party guidance.


Competitive changes in the market, as new providers enter and existing
providers adjust to competitive pressures, will change the cost structure of
health insurance.


By assuming that risk in
a carefully planned way, employers might be able to realize substantial savings
over a fully-insured plan.


Retirement Plan Issues

In a similar way, the world of retirement plans is undergoing a dramatic change:

There is increasing discussion of the need to save more for retirement, and
employees will be looking to employers to help them achieve that goal.


In recent
years, the "standard" type of plan has been the 401(k), but there is a limit to
how much can be saved through a 401(k) plan.


In earlier years, many employers
sponsored defined benefit pension plans, which, at least for older employees,
could result in a greater accumulation of benefits than was possible in defined
contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans.


But defined benefit plans can develop
large unfunded liabilities, which in recent years have begun migrating to the
liabilities section of the employer's balance sheet, as a result of changes in
accounting standards.


More recently, a shift has begun from defined benefit
pension plans to cash balance plans.


Despite some uncertainty as to whether
these plans violated age discrimination laws, they now seem well established and
capable of assisting employers in controlling future costs.


Much attention has been devoted in recent times to investments in retirement
plans.


The recent financial inquiries into costs in the insurance and securities
industries are spreading to retirement plan assets, and litigation is sure to
follow.


What does it cost to invest in retirement plan assets and to administer
retirement plans?


If so, plan participants are not being
treated fairly, and have a right to complain.


In effect, revenue is
paid to someone because the plan's assets are invested in the mutual funds.


The appropriate inquiry for in-house counsel is what services are being provided
to the retirement plan, what they should reasonably cost, and what service
providers are earning.


As with health insurance, this inquiry generally
cannot be made without expert assistance but, with expert assistance, counsel
can ensure that participants in retirement plans are getting the greatest
benefits from their contributions and can avoid claims that employers have
failed to carry out their responsibilities for stewardship of retirement plans.


Retirement
plans are a form of deferred compensation under that inclusive definition.


Nonqualified deferred compensation refers to arrangements that do not satisfy
the detailed rules of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified status, from which
follows the various tax benefits of qualified retirement plans.


A wide
range of types of nonqualified deferred compensation had developed, including
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock plans, supplemental executive
retirement plans, 401(k) mirror plans, management incentive plans and many
others.


Nonqualified deferred compensation plans could be tailored to specific
circumstances and could cover select groups of employees, which made up for the
loss of some of the favorable tax consequences of qualified plans.


This form of benefit planning changed substantially with the enactment of new
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as part of the American Jobs Creation
Act in 2004.


Limitations were placed on:

when compensation could be deferred

when distributions of deferred compensation could be made

when acceleration of payment was permissible

when further deferral of payment was permissible

certain types of funding techniques

In addition, and of some significance, the providers of deferred compensation
plans will now have to report the amount deferred on Form W-2, even if that
amount is not currently taxable.


For the first time, the Internal Revenue
Service will have information about how much income that would otherwise be
taxable is being deferred.


Armed with that knowledge,
and with the assistance of outside counsel, they should gather information about
the variety of nonqualified deferred compensation plans currently in effect.


This fact-gathering process might identify issues unrelated to the new law, such
as a failure to have adequate documentation and records of such plans.


Following that, counsel can participate in the decision how to revise
such plans.


Overall, a new level of awareness will be required, and an ongoing
discussion as to the proper management of nonqualified deferred compensation
plans.

cost-prohibitive

LENGTH: 517  words


Citadel Insurance plc.


The health plans, for adults,
children and companies offer a bespoke package of benefits designed to provide
care exactly when customers need it most.


The plans leave customers
entirely free to choose the specialist, hospital or clinic of their choice.


Citadel Insurance Managing Director Angela Tabone said: "Health insurance is
increasingly sought after by organisations as part of their employee benefits
package; so we have created group plans that help to positively manage the
health of a workforce in a practical and affordable way.


Of course the plans are
also available to those individuals or families who do not enjoy the benefit of
company paid health insurance.


These plans are all about regaining good health without delay, without
having to worry about treatments which could sometimes go beyond individuals'
financial means.


Also in the works is a new plan intended for young families and
single parents, which we will be launching shortly to complement Core, Comfort,
Complete, Child and Group."

Affiliated Workers Association launches new accident and short term medical
insurance plans

SECTION: ACCIDENT & HEALTHCARE; Business Expansions

LENGTH: 242 words



HIGHLIGHT: Affiliated Workers Association (AWA), through its exclusive
third-party administrator Homeland HealthCare, announced the launch of two new
insurance plans including an accident plan and guaranteed issue short term
medical plan.


The accident plan, called Protect Now, is underwritten by A-rated carrier XL
Catlin.


Three plan levels are available that provide accident protection that
pays cash benefits for covered accident expenses.


In addition to accident protection, the plan includes an added critical illness
benefit.


This plan is a great complement to an existing health plan, as it helps
pay for expenses while deductibles are being met.


The new short term medical plan, called Health Assure, is a guaranteed issue
(GI) plan underwritten by National Health Insurance Company.


This new GI short term medical plan does not require health questions to
qualify, making it the perfect solution for individuals who need temporary
health insurance.


Health Assure is available in term lengths of 6 and 11 months,
depending on the plan selected with a variety of deductible options.


Both the accident and GI short term medical plans include non-insured benefits,
such as 24/7 telemedicine services and a discount prescription program.


"AWA is excited to launch these two new supplemental insurance plans," said Neil
Peterson, AWA President.


"Both plans further extend the insurance options
available to our members, which is important with the changes that continue to
take place with the new health care law."


Other supplemental plans also available through AWA include gap, dental and
vision insurance through top-rated carriers with years of experience in the
insurance industry.


The district's current health-insurance plan, he noted, "just can't be sustained
by this over-taxed community."


"It's in the best interest of all taxpayers, including those who
have retired many years ago ... who are on fixed incomes."


If retired teachers were moved to the alternative plan, he said at the time, the
district would save $387,199 each year; moving retired CSEA members would reduce
annual costs by $87,199.


"In phone conversations with that consultant, he believes, given the data, he
can put together a different plan, which is different than Plan A and Plan B ...
and it cost less than Plan B," he said.


"Now if you impose something tonight, I
would tell you that working together and trying to come up with that plan will
probably be out the window."


"Our consultant on health insurance has told us that Plan B is not only
equivalent to the statewide plan, he's told us it's better," he said.


In addition, Krieg noted, it seems a move to the alternative plan is inevitable,
as the rising cost of Plan A has made it unsustainable.


In addition, Morris noted, "we should be trying to get out of this consortium
and get into a different health plan."


He added that he believes a large number of Plattsburgh residents do have
discretionary income, and the question is whether they wish to spend it on
public education and district employees' benefits, which are used in and flow
back into the local community.


"It's people who have the higher incomes, whose homes are assessed at a higher
value, that pay more in school taxes."


A recent Wisconsin Association of Health Plans analysis found that for the first
time more people now rely on taxpayer-funded health plans such as Medicaid than
on commercial insurance.


Commercial insurers say they can't cut premiums because of state fees and
coverage requirements.


Some state requirements for coverage, such as chiropractic care and certain
mental health services, affect only commercial plans, said Phil Dougherty,
deputy director of the Wisconsin Association of Health Plans, which represents
the state's health maintenance organizations or HMOs.


Also, he said, commercial plans are required to pay 20 percent of the cost of
HIRSP, a government plan for people who aren't eligible for coverage in the
private market, often because they have costly medical conditions.


But commercial health plans shouldn't complain about how much they have to
contribute to HIRSP, said Bobby Peterson, executive director of ABC for Health,
a public interest law firm that helps people obtain health insurance.


Many
high-risk people are in the costly program because they have been turned down by
commercial plans, he said.


"They're written out of (the commercial) plans because they have pre-existing
medical conditions," he said.


Commercial and self-funded private insurance plans are both affected by
"cost-shifting," said Cheryl DeMars, marketing director of The Alliance, a
health-care purchasing cooperative in Madison composed of companies that provide
self-funded insurance.


Cost-shifting occurs when doctors and hospitals charge more to people on private
plans to compensate for payments that are sometimes lower from public plans.


Now, she's paying $220 for an insurance plan
that doesn't cover as much, which she purchased on her own.


When you buy a plan or policy, you pay a monthly fee and in return, the company
agrees to pay part of your medical expenses when you get sick or hurt.


Stewart: While no one plans to get sick or hurt, most people need medical care
at some point.


Stewart: If you can afford health insurance coverage in 2015, but don't sign up,
you will have to pay a penalty ($325 per adult, $162.40 per child -- up to $975
per family or 2 percent of income whichever is higher.


Stewart: The list is long, but here are a few reasons why a person might be
exempt: (A) Coverage is unaffordable coverage (more than 8 percent of household
income); (B) You are a member of federally recognized tribe; (C) You are below
tax filing threshold and not required to file taxes; (D) You have been uninsured
for less than three consecutive months during the year.


You can only purchase insurance outside of
that time period if you have a qualifying life event, such as a marriage,
divorce, new baby, and change of income, to name a few.


You are considered
covered if you have Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, any job-based plan, any plan
you've purchased yourself, COBRA, retiree coverage, Tricare, VA health coverage.


Stewart: Each plan varies in terms of overall cost and depends on the amount of
premium and deductible you choose.


You may also have an annual
deductible.


For example, let's say you have a plan
with a $200 deductible.


You pay
the first $200 to cover the deductible, and then your insurance pays its share.


How much you pay for your premium and deductible depends on the type of
insurance you have and whether you're purchasing individual or family coverage.


Q: What types of plans are there?


Stewart: There are four levels of qualified health plans on the Health Insurance
Marketplace: platinum, gold, silver, and bronze.


Each category has a different
monthly premium costs, as well as deductible.


There are a lot of affordable
options on the Health Insurance Marketplace and you can compare each plan side
by side so you can find the plan that meets you and/or your family's needs.


Stewart: The federal government can assist some individuals and families with
their premiums costs by providing subsidies to those who qualify based on their
income.


For example, if a family of four had an income of about $40,000 in 2014,
they maybe eligible for subsidy assistance on premium costs that exceed 5
percent of their income.


If that same family of four purchases a Silver plan
that might cost them around $9,400 per year, they could eligible to receive
subsidy assistance of up to almost $7,400; which means they would only be
responsible for about $2,000 of the insurance premium costs themselves.


And, equally important, parents can cover their children up to age 26 on their
insurance plan.


Stewart: The federal government has announced that for those consumers who are
already enrolled in a Marketplace plan in 2014, they will have an automatic
enrollment option to select the same health plan coverage in 2015.


Stewart: In addition to pre-existing conditions, all qualified health plans must
offer Ambulatory patient services; Hospitalization and emergency services;
Maternity and newborn care; Mental Health and substance use disorder;
Prescription drugs; Lab services; Preventative and wellness services; Chronic
disease management; and Pediatric services, including dental and vision care.


Of
course, you have to meet your deductible before insurance pays.


Q: Are there qualified health plans cover preventive care services at no charge?


Stewart: Yes, qualified plans cover many preventive care screenings, tests and
services such as vaccinations that can help adults and children stay healthy.


And the best news is, they're free -- no copays or deductibles.


For women, many preventive care screenings, tests and supplies that can help
with family planning and pregnancy are now covered, along with services such as
these: Well-woman checkups; Contraceptives and birth control counseling;
Screenings during pregnancy for a variety of conditions; Breastfeeding supplies,
support and counseling.


Q: Besides a health insurance plan on the Health Insurance Marketplace, what
other types of health insurance are available?


Stewart: Many families with limited income will qualify for Medicaid or
Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and they can enroll any time of the
year.


Medicaid provides health coverage for some low-income people, families and
children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities.


In some
states the program covers all low-income adults below a certain income level.


Individuals and
employer groups may purchase insurance plans on the Marketplace beginning Oct.
1, 2013.


The specifics about what individual health plans will be offering will
not be available until Oct. 1.


"UPMC Health Plan is pleased to begin helping individuals find the health plan
that fits their needs and helping employers find plans that are right for their
companies," said Diane P. Holder, President and CEO of UPMC Health Plan.


"Our
wide variety of offerings assures that individuals and companies on all
different income levels will find a plan that fits their needs.


The plans, which will be known as University Healthcare Marketplace
Canyon Plans, will provide affordable access to innovative, compassionate and
member-focused care.


We have designed our
plans with competitive rates and reasonable deductibles and copays.


* Up to five primary care visits at no cost on some plans.

From the start of next month, the cost of Aviva's Level 2 hospital plan will
rise by 9.5 per cent for existing customers, and new customers will face a
premium increase of almost 20 per cent for the same cover.


Aviva's last price rise - a 14 per cent price increase across all consumer plans
-was effective from March 1.The insurer said it increased prices twice in one
year due to the ''dynamic'' nature of the market, saying things had ''changed
significantly since the beginning of this year''.


VHI's prices last increased in February, with price increases varying across
different types of plan, with hikes of between 15 and 45 per cent.


According to Loughlin, consumers should keep an eye on corporate health
insurance plans.


Market trends

In a market with three main providers and more than 250 health insurance plans
to choose from, consumers are understandably a bit overwhelmed.


Figures from the HIA show that the number of people insured with an inpatient
health insurance policy declined by 14,000 in the first quarter of 2011,
continuing the gradual fall in the number insured since early 2009.Today just
under half the population have in-patient health insurance cover.


''There has been a growth in the number of people who are purchasing plans with
an excess," said VHI's spokeswoman.


According to Quinn's spokeswoman, the majority of the company's health insurance
customers are on plans with an excess, while recent customer research by Aviva
indicated that Irish consumers would accept an excess in order to reduce their
premium.


''The majority of our customers opt for plans that have cover for hospital
treatment as these plans have lower premiums than plans with additional day to
day benefits as well as hospital cover," said Aviva's spokeswoman.


Loughlin predicted that health insurance plans would become more tailored as the
market continues to develop.


For example, the VHI has just launched its latest plan, called One Plan Sport,
which is designed for sports enthusiasts.


Looking further ahead, universal health insurance is one of the central planks
of the current government's proposals on health reform and effectively means
that health insurance will be mandatory by 2016.


According to the Programme for Government, the state will pay insurance premiums
for people on low incomes and subsidise insurance premiums for people on middle
incomes.

General Insurance: Make It Sufficient Super Top-up Plans are Turning a Boon in
Enhancing the Health Coverage

LENGTH: 842  words


Many of us feel relieved and protected having bought a health insurance plan.


Topping It Up

A top-up health insurance plan is a regular indemnity plan that covers
hospitalization costs, but only after a threshold limit is crossed.


In insurance
parlance, this limit is called deductible.


A deductible is that portion of the
claim amount that is not covered by the insurer and has to be paid by the
insured person before the benefits of the policy can kickin.


So, if you already
have a health insurance policy or are covered by your employer, the deductible
limit can be paid by the employer's policy and anything above that limit by the
top-up cover.


The difference between a super top up plan and a top up plan lies in its
working.


In a top up plan, the reimbursement for medical expenses is for a
single illness.


In a super top-up plan, the expenses
covered are for all illnesses put together that occur during an entire year.


In a regular health insurance plan, expenses reimbursed are upto the sum insured
in the policy.


In a top up/super top plan, the medical expenses are covered on
the basis of a threshold limit.


This threshold limit (also known as compulsory
deductibles) is the level from where the plan would start kicking-in.


Any claims
over and above this threshold limit would be entertained under top up/super top
up plans.


8,00,000 and an aggregate deductible of Rs.


The aggregate deductible
is the amount that client's existing health insurance policy will pay for
medical expenses incurred.


2,00,000
(aggregate deductible) is paid by him/her for current health insurance policy,
the additional Rs.8,00,000 will be paid by us.


Conclusion

As far as health insurance needs rise, being covered under the corporate group
plan of your employer or buying a policy for a tiny sum insured of, say, Rs.1-2
lakh is not enough.


Medical costs have skyrocketed and the process to port health
insurance from a corporate plan to an individual plan is not smooth.


For such individuals, a
health insurance top-up plan is an excellent way to increase the cover, while
keeping costs in check.


Things to remember before buying a top-up plan: -

Consider the exact requirement for self or for the family.


* The top-up plan's deductibles should be less than or equal to the base policy
sum insured.


* Top-up plans provide dual benefits of low cost and higher sum insured.


* For the salaried, who are covered under employer's health insurance policy
should also buy a top-up plan for higher protection.


Build them into your healthcare planning.


The open enrollment period for 2016 health insurance plans
started November 1, 2015 and is scheduled to continue through January 31, 2016.


"It's the one time of
year when everyone should reconsider their health insurance options, because the
best plan for you in 2016 isn't necessarily the plan you had in 2015.


In fact,
this open enrollment period might be your only chance to change your current
health insurance plan before 2017!


A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of
11 cities shows that monthly premiums for benchmark plans are increasing an
average of 4.4%, though some cities will see an increase of 10% or more1.


Your annual deductible and copayments may change too - Even if your monthly
premiums aren't changing significantly, pay attention to any changes in your
out-of-pocket medical costs for 2016.


Are your copayments increasing?


What about
your annual deductible?


A recent eHealth report shows that what you pay out of pocket
for prescription drugs and medical care has a big impact on your overall
satisfaction with your health plan2.


Your 2015 health insurance plan may be discontinued.


Some insurance companies
are no longer offering certain 2015 health insurance plans in 2016.


Insurance
companies sometimes retire older plans or simply opt to leave a specific market.


Others may be closing down PPO plans in favor of HMO plans.


If your 2015 health
insurance plan is going away, you'll need to get out there and shop for
something new - and re-apply for any subsidies you may have qualified for in
2015.


On the other hand, new plans may be available to you.


Though some insurers
are retiring old plans, others are rolling out new individual and family health
insurance plans for 2016.


You may find that one of these new plans is well suited to your
personal coverage needs and budget.


Whether
you're keeping your 2015 plan or enrolling in something new for 2016, be aware
of how you may be affected by changes to your coverage or to your network of
doctors and hospitals.


Are the drugs you use still covered at an affordable
copayment?


Some insurers are
moving to a two-tiered network model where you pay a higher or lower copayment
depending on which medical providers you want to see.


You may need to actively opt-in to stick with your current plan.


Depending on
the rules in your state, if your insurance company makes certain changes to your
coverage for 2016, you may need to actively indicate you want to stay enrolled
in your plan next year.


Private online marketplaces like eHealth
offer Obamacare-compliant health insurance plans that meet your coverage
requirements under the law and which aren't available through government-run
exchanges.


If you are uninsured for longer than
two consecutive months in 2016, you could face the biggest-ever Obamacare tax
penalty: $695 per adult (and $347.50 per child) or 2.5% of your taxable
household income, whichever is greater, subject to certain limits and
exceptions.


The
earliest that coverage under a new plan can begin is January 1.


For a smoother
transition from your 2015 plan to your 2016 plan, you may want to enroll before
December 15, 2015.

HEALTH insurance companies today stand accused of "playing down" price increases
on some of their plans.


According to new research, a 20pc price increase flagged by Laya will actually
see some of its plans rise by between 35pc and 40pc.


Over at the VHI, a 3pc price increase actually means that one of its most
popular plans will increase by 8pc.


The health insurance companies argue that the increases they announced are
"average" over all their plans.


Patrick Brennan, of the advisory service Irish Health Insurance, has estimated
that there are over 260 different health insurance plans and a majority simply
sign up for one plan and stay on it.


He believes that before leaving the market altogether, consumers should look at
a compromise solution: review your plan to fit your current family
circumstances, which may be quite different to the ones you signed up for and
might yield considerable savings.


It also may be time for the heath insurance companies themselves to review the
number of plans on offer and streamline these to reflect the new reality.

The deadline is approaching to sign up for a plan on the state's health
insurance marketplace, even as the future of the Affordable Care Act is in
question.


Jan. 31 is the last day for people to purchase a 2017 plan on healthcare.gov.


It's unclear yet what, if
anything, Republicans plan to replace it with.


Trump told The Washington Post
last week that he's nearly done with a plan to replace the ACA with a law that
aims for "insurance for everybody, though he didn't outline the details.


Republican leaders have also said they don't plan to take coverage away from the
around 20 million people who have gained health insurance through the ACA, the
Post reported, but how they will do that remains to be seen.


Those who sign up for an insurance plan by Jan. 31 would get coverage starting
March 1, Smith said.


In West Virginia, two insurance companies offer plans on the state's exchange:
Parkersburg-based Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield and Dayton, Ohio-based
CareSource.


Highmark offers plans in all 55 counties.


Both companies are offering bronze,
silver and gold plans, Smith said.


"Our top priority is to ensure that there is a smooth transition to a better
health care system, with minimal disruption to our members, and to their choice
of health plan and doctor, she said.


The penalty for not having health insurance this year will be $695 or 2.5
percent of a person's annual income, whichever is greater, he said.


"Last year, 86 percent of West Virginians who purchased plans on the marketplace
were able to get tax credits, he said.


Some companies sell limited benefit plans, which don't offer all services and
don't meet the guidelines for the Affordable Care Act, he said.


Those who buy
those sorts of plans will still be required to pay a penalty, he said.

Health Insurance Reform Goes Retail in NC: New Store Opens for One-Stop Health
Insurance Shopping

LENGTH: 262  words


New Delhi, Oct. 4 -- Residents in the Asheville area who prefer to have a
face-to-face conversation with a real person when it comes to something as
personal as selecting a health insurance plan are in luck!


The Grand opening for The Asheville Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina
Store is planned for Saturday, October 5, 2013 from 11am to 3pm.


Visitors to the new retail store will be able to get expert answers to questions
about Obamacare and the new Health Insurance Marketplace and received
personalized assistance in selecting the best health insurance plan to meet
their needs, all at no extra cost.


They will walk with each person,
step-by-step, through the process of selecting an insurance plan.


More than a year later, the group -- now called Wisconsin Health Care for All --
has a plan that members say is attractive to small businesses in the city that
are seeking health insurance for their employees.


It is based loosely on what the state of Maryland has approved, a "pay or play"
plan that requires businesses to either insure their workers or pay into a fund
that's used to provide coverage through competitive bids by private providers.


John Kalfayan, an economist and one of the leaders of the group, said the plan
holds promise because it does not disrupt the structure that's already in place
for providing health insurance.


Under the group's plan, any employer that is not providing health insurance
would be required to pay into a government administered fund.


Of course, Kalfayan acknowledges, there would be ready opponents to this plan,
namely businesses that are not seeking health insurance for their employees and
do not want to incur additional costs for a universal plan.


"Government has a role in protecting citizens," Kalfayan said of pursuing the
plan in spite of these concerns.


Ann Fleischli, another leader of the group, said members have been working on
surveying local businesses about the plan and so far have found overwhelming
support on routes down Monroe and Williamson streets.


One approach the group is discussing is to petition for a referendum on the
plan.


Mayor Dave Cieslewicz has also declined to support the plan, citing City
Attorney Michael May's opinion that the city could not collect the money to
support the plan without violating laws controlling payroll taxes.

Here's how you can save tax on health insurance premium

BYLINE: Sunil Dhawan

SECTION: TAX

LENGTH: 672 words


Most financial planners suggest that the first step in any financial plan should
be to ensure that one has adequate health insurance.


What's more, the premium paid for health insurance also provides a
tax benefit by reducing your taxable income and thereby your tax liability.


Here
are five crucial things to know about tax benefits of health insurance plans as
per income tax laws for fiscal 2016-2017.


Tax benefit available on all types of health insurance

Both 'indemnity' and 'defined benefit' kinds of health insurance plans would
qualify for tax benefit.


Not just the indemnity plans such as individual health
insurance plan popularly called Mediclaim and Family Floater plans but also
defined benefit plans such as daily hospital cash plan and critical illness plan
of any standalone health insurance company or a general insurance company would
qualify for such tax benefit.


Life insurance companies riders

The Section 80D tax benefit is on the premium paid towards health policy and
therefore does not restrict one to buy health plan only from health insurance
companies.


Cash payment: One may pay premium in cash, however, in order to avail tax
benefit, the income tax rules disallows tax benefit on premium paid in cash.


Lastly, as health
insurance plans vary a lot in terms of features, make an informed buying
decision.


The Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services will submit
recommendations for qualified health plans by Aug. 8 to the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services.


Nearly 273,000 Michigan residents have selected private insurance plans under
the federal health care law, exceeding initial projections by more than 100,000.

Schumer proposes public health plan

BYLINE: Maury Thompson, The Post-Star, Glens Falls, N.Y.


More than 750,000 New Yorkers who have health insurance still spend more than 25
percent of their pre-tax income on health care costs.


One of the primary reasons for high health care costs is the lack of competition
between health insurance plans, Schumer said.


Schumer wants to "inject competition" into the marketplace by establishing a
public, nonprofit health plan that would compete with private plans.


The proposed plan would receive a one-time government subsidy to get started and
would then be self-sufficient.


But in the Glens Falls area, at least, there are more than 40 health insurance
plans offered by various commercial companies, said Todd Shimkus, president and
chief executive officer of the Adirondack Regional Chamber of Commerce.


"The fact here is competition is not an issue, and introducing another plan,
whether it's another private plan or a public plan, doesn't matter," he said.


Shimkus said the solution is to have more government regulation and oversight of
rates and plans.


He
said the proposed public plan would have all the same requirements, such as
reserve funds and regulations, as private plans.


A public plan could operate less expensively because the nonprofit entity would
not have to return profits to shareholders, and because it would have lower
salary and overhead costs, he said.


Typically, about 25 percent of the budget for commercial plans is for
administrative costs, compared with 3 percent for the federal Medicare plan for
senior citizens and the disabled, said Dr. John Rugge, executive director of
Hudson Headwaters Health Network, a regional chain of health clinics.


But Medicare does not have the same regulations as private plans, said Leslie
Moran, a spokeswoman for the New York Health Plan Association, a health
insurance industry trade group.


Private health plans in New York also pay $4 billion in taxes annually to
subsidize government health care programs, she said.


Getting the proposed public plan approved in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and
U.S. territories would be a huge undertaking, she said.


"I think he's (Schumer) doing New York state plans a big disservice on a number
of fronts," she said.


Schumer said his proposal for a public plan would not be a government takeover
of health care because people could still buy health insurance from commercial
plans if they wanted to and could afford the coverage.


Schumer said he also is pushing for another initiative called a "health
exchange," that would be an Internet-based system where consumers could compare
health insurance plans and prices and buy the coverage they prefer.


Schumer said there does not appear to be a broad base of support for
establishing a single national health insurance plan that covers everyone.


McCain's approach would have taxed employer-sponsored health insurance as
income, which would have removed the tax exemption granted to the roughly 177
million Americans who receive health insurance through their employers.


McCain
planned to the proposed tax credit to offset that hit.


Obama's plan tilted toward expanding government-issued health insurance.


Small employers, along with those who had no employer-sponsored health insurance
, could enroll in the new program, with subsidies available based on income.


Under Obama's plan, all children would be required to have health insurance.


There still remains the disagreement among party lines over who actually pays
for healthcare beyond the deductible - the government or a health insurance
company.


Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi introduced legislation last summer
that would have enacted a plan similar to McCain's.


Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi supports a universal healthcare
plan similar to Obama's.


With so many factions supporting the two fundamentally different payer plans,
and with the enormity of the nation's healthcare system, sweeping reform is
unlikely to occur within a short period.


It was a rough, state-level version of McCain's national healthcare
plan that would not have tied employees to their employer-sponsored health
insurance.

Deadline for health care enrollment extended

BYLINE: The Trenton Sun staff

LENGTH: 297  words


Local residents interested in obtaining health care insurance coverage through
plans offered by Illinois' Health Insurance Exchange (also known as the Health
Insurance Marketplace) will need to enroll by December 23.


Coverage through
Marketplace insurance plans begins on January 1, 2014.


In an effort to help those who qualify for insurance coverage through the
ACA-sponsored Health Insurance Marketplace, St. Joseph's Hospital (SJH) in
Highland and the Madison County Health Department(MCHD) have teamed up to
provide a community outreach service for local residents and small businesses
who are eligible to enroll in insurance plans available through Illinois' Health
Insurance Marketplace.


Before making an appointment with the certified application counselor at SJH,
individuals must consider the following: If an individual already is enrolled in
Medicare, they don't need to enroll in plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace

If an individual already has health insurance coverage through their employer,
or health insurance coverage is available to them through their employer, they
don't need to enroll in plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace

If an individual is unemployed, they can enroll in Marketplace plans

If health insurance premium costs are equal to or greater than 10% of
personal/household income, they may be eligible

Cabinet approves draft plan for elderly medical coverage

LENGTH: 264 words


The cabinet approved March 28 a blueprint for medical reform focusing on the
creation of a new health insurance plan for people 75 or older.


The ministry aims to implement the plan in fiscal 2008.


The plan will be funded by existing health insurance programs and government
subsidies, as well as premiums paid by participants.


The blueprint further recommends funneling funds from a health insurance program
for salaried people to support a plan for self-employed and retired people that
has many subscribers aged 65-74, an age group that also use medical insurance
more often than those still working.


Among other proposals in the draft reform plan is to shift the management of the
health insurance program for self-employed and retired people to prefectural
governments from city, town or village authorities.


However, the draft plan largely avoided specifics, such as what entity will
administer the new insurance program.

PAWLENTY SAYS OBAMACARE IS PATTERNED AFTER ROMNEYCARE

BYLINE: ANGIE DROBNIC HOLAN

SECTION: POLITIFACT

LENGTH: 997 words


"Obamacare was patterned after (Mitt Romney's) plan in Massachusetts."


"Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts.


And for Mitt or
anyone else to say that there aren't substantial similarities or they're not
essentially the same plan, it just isn't credible.


So are the national health plan and the Massachusetts plan that similar?


We've explored their similarities before in previous fact-checks, when liberals
have made similar statements defending the Obama plan against critics who
labeled it extreme.


We'll review the two plans' similarities again here.


Everyone in Massachusetts must
purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the federal
plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.


Both the Massachusetts and national plans involve
the use of voluntary "exchanges" that individuals and small businesses can use
to purchase private-sector health insurance.


These exchanges are designed to
offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.


Under both plans, lower-income individuals and
families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health
insurance premiums.


In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a
sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.


Under the national
plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty
level.


The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children
up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.


The federal plan also expands
Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just
children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.


Both plans restructure the insurance market, in
similar but slightly different ways.


In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on
their parents' plan, while the federal law allows such dependent coverage up to
age 26.


Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for
its lack of cost-containment provisions.


The federal law makes changes to
Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how
payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare.


Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address
this issue.


Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by
revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates.


But the
Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal
matching funds, while the federal law, in addition to cost savings from
Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and
indoor tanning services.


It also taxes high-cost ("Cadillac") health care plans.


The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things.


We should note that the plans are so similar, we made a quiz, selecting passages
from each plan to see if our readers could tell the difference.


Pawlenty said that "Obamacare was patterned after Mitt's plan in Massachusetts."


He didn't say it was the same plan, but instead said that the
national law was "patterned" after the Massachusetts law, and they had
"substantial similarities."


He's correct that the plans, thought not completely
identical, are very similar in structure.


Because his statement accurately categorized the plans as similar --
but not exactly the same -- we rate Pawlenty's statement True.


), who specializes in
providing health insurance to restaurant and hotel employers, recently announced
their new and improved plans.


These new plans include an extended PPO network,
and employer flexibility for contribution and participation.


With healthcare reform affecting so many hotels and restaurants, these new plans
with industry specific flexibility will be essential for the hospitality to get
through the healthcare reform changes unscathed.


The performance-based health plan (PPO) is from a H.I.H.I.T.


This brand new plan aims to drive employee engagement in healthy
behavior and better health care choices by offering preferred pricing for higher
performing providers.


Plus, each client's plan is reviewed in detail to ensure it's the
best fit for their unique situation.


H.I.H.I.T decided to employ these new plans with the mission to help companies
in the restaurant and lodging industry to save time and be compliant, while
providing the absolute best health insurance to employees.

City workers able to keep care provider;
 Health plan changes made

BYLINE: Nick Kotsopoulos; TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg.


B1

LENGTH: 675 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER



- Municipal employees have won their fight to retain Blue Cross and Blue Shield
as one of their health insurance providers.


However, there will be some changes to their plans.


Janice Borg Silverman, the city's director of human resources, said the city
intends to move forward with a plan that will include Blue Cross and Fallon
Community Health Plan as the health insurance providers for active and retired
municipal employees.


She said the plan will result in a $10.2 million increase in the city's health
insurance costs for the fiscal year that begins July 1.


That is $900,000 less
than what the health insurance increase would have been had there been a
''status quo enrollment'' with no plan design changes.


City officials had originally hoped to cap the health insurance increase for
next year at $4 million to $4.5 million and wanted to drop Blue Cross as a
health insurance provider.


''We have had limited success in plan design changes, and no success with
employee contribution changes,'' Ms. Silverman wrote in a report to City Manager
Thomas R. Hoover.


The plan changes include the following:

Blue Choice will have a $5 office visit co-payment, from the current $3
co-payment, and emergency room visits will cost $50.


Medex will have a new $250 annual deductible for retail prescription drugs.


Retirees covered under that program currently have a $35 per quarter deductible.


There will be no changes to the Fallon plan for active employees and qualified
retirees, the Fallon Senior Plan, or the Blue Cross Master Medical Plan, Ms.
Silverman said.


She added, however, the city has concerns with its existing Blue Care 65 Plan --
a Medicare supplement plan in which more than 600 retirees are enrolled.


She
said there has been significant provider disruption lately because of the
termination of the contract with physicians at Chadwick Medical Associates.


''We have found what we believe to be a far richer plan in terms of benefits and
service co-payments in the Managed Blue for Seniors Plan,'' Ms. Silverman said.


''This plan, however, is more expensive than the existing Blue Care 65 Plan, and
is priced accordingly.''


Ms. Silverman said she believes the increased cost to retirees will be more than
offset by the enhanced benefits they will receive under the new plan.


She
said the notices will include additional information on plan changes, new
premiums and educational seminars.

New York: New Student Health Insurance Plan and Policy Introduced

LENGTH: 824  words

DATELINE: Albany


Syracuse University, The State of New York has issued the following News
release:

In accordance with the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010 (ACA), Syracuse University will be offering a new student health insurance
plan as of Aug. 1.


The plan offering coincides with a revised University
policy--to be phased in over the next two years--requiring that all full-time
students carry some form of ACA-compliant health insurance.


The decision, based on the recommendations of the University's Student Health
Insurance Advisory Committee, is designed to ensure students have the health
coverage vital to their well-being and to meet the requirements of the new
health care reforms.


"Our current health insurance plan was unsustainable as it was," says Senior
Vice President and Dean of Student Affairs Rebecca Reed Kantrowitz.


"To provide
all students with access to an affordable, ACA-compliant plan, we needed to
assess different options to ensure no student was left underinsured and at risk
of jeopardizing their education or financial stability.


Starting August 1, the plan will be available to all students.


Those students
will be required to demonstrate proof of appropriate existing coverage prior to
registration for classes or adopt the student health insurance plan through
Aetna Student Health.


The premium for this improved plan is less than $2,000 a
year--a significant reduction from what's currently available through the
federal government's health exchange marketplace, as well as the University's
current plan, which is being discontinued.


This can include insurance provided through a parent's
family plan, through an employer, health care exchange or other source.


Those
without qualifying coverage will be required to enroll in the University's
student health insurance plan.


To assist students with these changes and to provide more details on the new
student health insurance plan and proof of insurance requirement, informational
sessions are scheduled for Tuesday, April 14, from 6-7 p.m. and Wednesday, April
15, from 5:30-6:30 p.m. in Grant Auditorium.

   Best Health Insurance Plans is a free service designed to deliver the best
health insurance quotes directly to you.


For more than 30 years, people have relied on short-term health
insurance in a range of situations, including workers who are in between jobs,
children and spouses no longer eligible under an employer-sponsored plan, and
college graduates and students who need coverage for the summer.


When transitions take longer than expected or exceed the term of the initial
short-term plan, consumers must reapply for new short-term coverage.


However, AgileHealthInsurance.com has streamlined the application process so
consumers can select the same plan as their current one or apply for a different
plan, all online and in just a few minutes.


Agile's innovative process is
designed to help consumers avoid lapses in coverage, as well as overlapping
premiums with multiple plans and offers a hassle-free experience for consumers.


"AgileHealthInsurance.com's proprietary technology has
simplified the shopping, application and now the reapplication process so
consumers have access to the short-term health plan they need and for as long as
they need it.


Most short-term plans include broad networks or no
in-network requirement so people can see providers anywhere in the country.


Eligibility requirements and flexibility in benefits contribute to the cost
savings realized by consumers.


These plans are not for everyone, but answering
five to seven questions about your health condition will tell you if you
qualify.


Short-term health insurance is considered "creditable coverage" under the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is very important
when you are transitioning from one group plan to another, such as an
employer-based plan.


Under federal law, if you have a gap in insurance coverage
longer than 63 days, your subsequent employer-based plan can impose a wait
period of several months before you will be insured for these conditions.


That
is why it's important to have continuous health coverage under a "creditable"
plan, such as short-term health insurance.


There
needed to be at least four levels of benefits with a fifth high-deductible plan
for young adults under the age of 30.


States, not the federal government, must determine what benefit
and provider mandates should be included in the various plans offered in the
exchange.


Plans offered outside of the exchange must essentially be identical to
plans offered within the exchange.


Washington state now has 58 benefit and provider mandates required in every
individual health insurance plan sold in the state.


Studies show that each of
these mandates adds, on average, 0.5 to 1.5 percent to the cost of any given
plan.


These
mandates not only increase the cost of insurance but also reduce the choice of
insurance plans for consumers.


This new HHS ruling allows Washington state officials to redesign the entire
list of health insurance plans offered to the public.


Within a few federal
guidelines, the state now has a clean slate to develop an array of affordable
plans that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients - young and old,
men and women, families and single people.


This board will determine the plans and benefit levels people are
allowed to buy through our state exchange.


The board should act in a nonpartisan fashion and should design a range of
plans, from low-priced catastrophic, high-deductible plans to expensive
full-benefit, first-dollar coverage.


Allowing multiple levels of benefit plans would hold costs
down for patients and would also save money for taxpayers who must provide the
subsidies for users of the exchange.


Its portfolio of products include whole-life
plan, wealth plan, education plan, level term plan, decreasing term plan,
personal accident plan, travel insurance plan, retirement plan, group life plan

Furthermore, the company offers health insurance
products, which comprise individual and group health plans.


BUSINESS DESCRIPTION:



Takaful Emarat is a provider of takaful insurance products.


It
also provides credit and savings insurance plans.


The company's Takaful division is focused on underwriting takaful products such
as health insurance, life insurance and, credit and savings plans.


The individual

level term plan, education plan, retirement plan, decreasing term plan, and

The corporate life insurance plans offered by the company
consist of group life and group credit life plans.


The Medical
sub-division of the company provides health insurance products for individuals
and corporates, including individual health insurance and group health insurance
plans.


However, for those that do not have this
coverage, and for those that want to provide coverage for the whole family, it
is important to look into the range of available plans and start this protective
health coverage as soon as possible.


Types of Health Insurance Plans; There are a number of different plans available
for those looking for health insurance coverage.


You can opt for an individual
plan if the coverage is just for yourself.


This often works out cheaper than taking out individual plans for each
member of the household, and ensures that your loved ones are all covered with
the same level of protection.


When looking into taking out permanent health insurance you need to pay careful
attention to what each plan actually covers before you make any commitment.


Some
plans will cover medical needs only, whereas more comprehensive plans will also
cover dental and optical care.


With a comprehensive permanent health insurance
plan you can expect benefits such as:

"Physician care

"Hospital care (as in-patient or out-patient)

"Dental, optical, and aural care

"Prescription benefits

"Surgery and major medical benefits

Insurance Costs vs. Benefits; As with any other type of insurance, the more
comprehensive plans will also cost more in premiums, but at the same time will
also provide a higher degree of protection and peace of mind.


It is very
important to read the policy in full before committing, as many health insurance
plans contain a lot of exclusions.


Providing that you are happy with the terms and conditions as well as the
benefits and exclusions of the insurance plan, permanent health insurance
coverage will provide you with an affordable and effective way to protect the
health and well being of yourself and your family.

In addition, Ignagni says, research must be made more transparent and accessible
for both providers and consumers.


As for evidence-based medicine, Ignagni notes that AHIP has asked every state
that requires external review of health plan decisions to base those reviews on
evidence-based medicine.


According to the policy initiative, a variety of approaches are needed to reduce
the number of uninsured Americans, including creation of high-risk health pools,
bridge loans to help workers maintain their coverage when they become
unemployed, public programs for those living below the poverty line and tax
incentives for higher income workers who are uninsured.

Washington is accustomed to phantom voters, phantom income and phantom
employees, but the House yesterday passed legislation to create a novel member
of the ghost family -- the phantom health insurance premium.


The government, under law, averages the premiums of six health plans and pays 60
percent of that figure per enrollee.


Aetna was one of the "big six" plans.


Aetna's premiums have been high in comparison to those of some other plans
because it has tended to insure people who incur more medical bills.


The bill, introduced by Rep. William D. Ford (D-Mich.), essentially directs the
government to proceed as if Aetna were still part of the government insurance
system, raising rates by the same average amount as the remaining big five
plans.


Without the "phantom" health plan, increases might total 32
percent, Ford said.


The Office of Management and Budget opposed the bill, saying it "relies on a
highly artificial 'phantom' premium based on the premium of a no-longer
participating plan."


More than 400 insurance plans are included in the federal health insurance
system around the world.


Workers in Washington have a choice of about 25 plans.

Colorado: Workshops Offered by Extension: Helping the Public Make Smart Choices
about Health Insurance

LENGTH: 386  words

DATELINE: Denver


County of Larimer, The State of Colorado has issued the following news release:


Fall is the season for health insurance plan enrollment.


Participants learn key health insurance terms; how
to estimate costs for health care and what questions to ask; and how to find
information to choose a health plan.


"Smart Choice is not about pushing you to select any one specific plan," says
Laurel Kubin, County Extension Director.


"It will help you gain a set of skills
so you can choose a plan that best fits your family's needs."

The Patriot Ledger

BRAINTREE - Selectmen are weighing a proposal that would give them the power to
negotiate changes to employee health insurance plans collectively with the
town's employee unions.


The plan, which is being pushed by the town's eight major collective bargaining
groups, would eliminate the current practice of negotiating changes with each
union.


Such a move would mean the town would be able to enact changes to employee
health insurance plans faster and cheaper.


He did not propose any specific changes to the employee health insurance plan.


The bill is S. 1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and
Affordability Act, which would allow self-employed workers and small-business
employees to band together through a trade or professional association to
negotiate lower health insurance costs, giving them access to the same quality
group health insurance plans currently available to union workers and employees
of large corporations.


Small-business health plans would be able to take advantage of the same
administrative savings and increased negotiating powers as large corporate and
union plans.


Her costs continue to rise at the same time that her deductible increases
and her coverage decreases.


Not surprisingly, many of the interest groups
lobbying against the bill represent the very health providers who benefit from
mandates.


The fact is that if a small-business health plan does not comply with a state's
coverage mandates then an additional policy must be offered to association
members that complies either with state law or with the coverage included in one
of the five most populous states' state employee plans (California, New York,
Florida, Illinois or Texas).


States, like the federal government, offer their
employees some of the best insurance plans today.


Another misconception is that small-business plans will "cherry-pick" and cover
only healthy workers.


Specific provisions have been included in the
bill to maintain a level playing field between small-business plans and
state-regulated plans that will prevent "cherry-picking."


Small-business health plans will be regulated by state insurance commissioners,
not the federal government.


Insurers participating in small-business health
plans must be licensed in all states in which association members are enrolled.


Also, small-business plans,
as authorized by S. 1955, must be structured as fully insured insurance
programs.

NB health insurance plan change upheld;
Arbitrator rules union contract was violated, but village retains authority to
choose plan

BYLINE: The Trenton Sun staff

LENGTH: 922  words


An arbitrator in the grievance filed by New Baden's police union has agreed that
the village of New Baden violated the union's collective bargaining agreement in
the way it handled a change in health insurance benefits last year, but not in a
way that requires the village to undo its prior action.


Arbitrator Elaine Frost issued her ruling on August 23, and said that New Baden
police are not entitled to have their health insurance benefits restored, nor to
compensation for additional expenses they may have incurred since the plan was
modified, although the village did not provide sufficient 'consultation'
opportunities for union members to air their opinions on the new plan that was
put in place.


Earlier in 2011, the village was advised by its carrier, The Principal Life
Insurance Company, that it would no longer write health insurance policies, and
village administrator Morani contacted a broker to get quotes and consult on
medical plans.


The collective bargaining agreement gives the village the right to choose the
health insurance plan, with the only limit being a cap on the amount of
deductible.


United Healthcare's plan that was most similar to The Principal's
existing coverage would have held costs about static, but the village was able
to save about $10,000 in annual premiums by modifying the plan.


Under the plan
the board selected, the deductible did not increase nor did the total out of
pocket expense.


Prior to its final vote on the new plan, the board discussed the matter at its
committee-at-large meeting on September 19, and that discussion was reported in
The Sun.


Police officers expressed
their opposition to the proposed plan at that meeting, according to Morani's
testimony as well as that of police union shop steward Angela Wagner and police
sergeant Scott Meinhardt, who was the lead negotiator on the union contract.


The
village board approved the modified plan October 3 at its regular monthly
meeting, at which no members of the bargaining unit appeared.


The Union argued that since the collective bargaining agreement specifically
addresses plans changes in the case of exorbitant premium increases and allowed
changes in deductibles, the rest of the plan's features are sacrosanct.


The arbitrator did not agree with the Union's position, since clear language in
the contract gives the employer the right to choose the health insurance plan
and the carrier for that plan, and since both parties agreed to the contract
language.


The arbitrator did conclude that good faith exercise by the employer when
selecting a new health insurance plan is required, and ruled that no
consultation was provided the Union, since it did not provide timely information
about its impending decision, "...the Union was not put on notice in early 2011
when the news reached the village; the Union was not approsed of the actions to
secure a broker to seek out alternative insurance carriers and plans; and it was
not advised when the results of the broker's actions were presented to the
Village Administrator..." according to the arbitrator, "...the actions of the
Employer in its repeated failure to timely disclose information about the need
to replace the health insurance carrier and plan, and the options for that
choice, was nothing short of highhanded."


The
village board retains its authority to choose the health insurance plan, subject
to the deductible limits set forth in the contract.

Experient Health: White House Announces Transition Policy for Canceled Health
Plans

LENGTH: 503  words


New Delhi, Nov. 30 -- The White House announced a transition policy for canceled
health plans, according to Experient Health, the health insurance arm of the
Virginia Farm Bureau.


For example,
effective for 2014 plan years, the ACA imposes new modified community rating
standards and requires individual and small group policies to cover a
comprehensive set of benefits.


Over the last few months, millions of Americans received notices informing them
that their health insurance plans are being canceled because they do not comply
with the ACA's reforms.


President Obama has received criticism that these cancellations go against his
assurances that if consumers have a plan that they like, they can keep it.


Also,
health insurance issuers are not required to follow the transition relief and
renew plans, and have expressed concern that the change could disrupt the new
risk pool under the federal and state Health Insurance Marketplaces.


Under this transitional policy, health insurance coverage in the individual or
small group market that is renewed for a policy year starting between Jan. 1,
2014, and Oct. 1, 2014 (and associated group health plans of small businesses),
will not be considered to be out of compliance with specified ACA reforms if
certain conditions are met.


The transitional relief is not available to grandfathered plans because these
plans are not subject to most of the ACA's market reforms.


According to
President Obama, the transition relief is an extension of the grandfathered plan
rules to additional health insurance policies.

The state's new health insurance plan has its limits, but it appears to be a
good start toward common- sense health insurance solutions.


The Cover Florida plan takes effect in January for applicants ages 19 to 64 who
have been without health insurance for at least six months, recently unemployed,
for people who have lost employer-sponsored health benefits or are no longer
covered by public health insurance in the last six months.


Six private insurers, including Jacksonville-based BlueCross BlueShield of
Florida, are offering the plans.


UnitedHealthcare also is offering plans
statewide.


Four other insurers are offering plans in counties outside Northeast
Florida.


- There are no traditional mandates, though state law does require the plans to
include certain basics.


This allows insurers and consumers more flexibility to
structure plans that fit consumer needs.


- Employers may voluntarily share in the cost of the plan, or they may offer
payroll deduction.


There are two kinds of plans: one that covers preventive medical care and
another that also covers catastrophic and health coverage.


For instance, for a 40-year-old male, Go Blue premiums for a catastrophic plan
are $106.


Promote health care standards and free physicians from
liability, reducing defensive medicine.


Holly A. Taylor of True North Financial Services, the city's health insurance
broker, has told the City Council that the city could initially save millions of
dollars by joining the GIC, but that those savings could dissipate due to the
cost of getting all 18 unions to agree to the plan.


The committee examined health insurance trends in
Pittsfield over the last 10 years and compared the city and the GIC plans under
various scenarios in a 27-page report.


The committee found the city could have saved $5.6 million in fiscal 2008 by
comparing the total health insurance costs for Pittsfield's employees and
retirees with a GIC cost scenario in which the entire city pool of employees and
retirees was split evenly between health maintenance organization and preferred
provider plans.


The total fiscal 2008 costs under Pittsfield's current health insurance plan are
$23.4 million, while the total costs under the GIC scenario were $17.8 million.


Lothrop said there are "accommodations" within the GIC plan to pay for a
community's catastrophic health insurance claims.


The committee also found that city employees who currently pay 20 percent of
their health insurance costs would realize annual savings of $451.44 on
individual plans, and $1,025.76 on family plans under the GIC.


The city, which
picks up 80 percent of its employees health insurance costs, would save
$1,805.76 annually on individual plans and $4,102.80 on family plans.


The GIC has 10 individual health insurance options as compared to four in the
city's plan, and some of the GIC's individual co-pays are higher than the
city's.


"Look at your own financial resources and health needs and decide which of the
plans works best for you and your family," she said.

The prospect of a new government health insurance plan highlighted a debate on
health care reform in Atlanta on Wednesday, in which four political heavyweights
offered a preview of the debate expected on Capitol Hill.


* Karl Rove --- Rove attacked the prospect of a government-offered public health
insurance plan, saying, "A public plan is a government-run plan.


And a
government-run plan is bad."


Citing a poll, he also said many people are happy with their health coverage,
and don't want to see any new plan hurt that coverage.


* Howard Dean --- Dean favored a public health insurance plan, though stressed
he did not want to do away with the private sector.


Frist also expressed concerns that a government health care plan would stifle
innovation and competition.


He said the public health care plan would address a major issue of Americans:
The need to lower health care costs.


In the first three months of this year, 21,000 people dropped their inpatient
health insurance, according to new data from the Health Insurance Authority.


There are now just over two million people with inpatient cover, compared with
almost 2.3 million people when the market peaked at the end of 2008.


Rising premiums and the recession have been the main factors in people giving up
inpatient private health insurance.


But he said that this was due to people dropping to cheaper plans and altering
the renewal date for their policies in a bid to keep premium costs down.


There have been a string of health insurance price rises this year alone, with
some plans soaring by as much as 41pc.


Some have responded by dropping their
cover, with others dropping down to cheaper plans.


In the latest move to ease the price pressure, the VHI said it would now extend
its half-price offer for children and students to all its hospital plans.


Benefits have also been reduced on plans.


With some plans, not every procedure
will be fully paid for, while excesses have been introduced across most plans.


Last summer, Aviva stepped up this trend to limit what a health policy covers a
step further by launching its Focus plans that restrict the hospitals where it
will pay for procedures.


The plans were 20pc cheaper than similar policies.


Laya followed with no-frills
plans of its own, also with major restrictions.

Gap still wide on medical reform

LENGTH: 542 words

HIGHLIGHT:
Debate over opposing plans expected to continue raging right up to March
deadline


The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry on Dec. 17 proposed two plans aimed at
easing the burdens on both young and old for the growing medical expenses of the
elderly.


Submission of two competing plans indicates the ministry's failure to
narrow the gap and produce a single plan.


Critics say there are drawbacks to
both plans.


This is sapping the stability of insurance plans for the younger
generation.


One of the ministry's plans to reduce the burden is to set up an individual
insurance plan for those aged 75 and older and to seek additional premium
payments from the elderly.


This plan would reduce health insurance society members' burdens by about 7,000
yen a year to 178,000 yen.


This plan
would also shrink the government's share of contributions by 400 billion yen in
fiscal 2007.


But if those aged 75 or older switch from public health insurance to the new
plan, the public health insurance plan's premium revenues will decline, making
their financial condition worse.


The ministry's other plan is to share the burden among the various health
insurance societies.


Insurance plans covering a large number of elderly people
will get financial support from plans that cover younger generations.


Likewise,
insurance plans with low-income members will receive support from corporate
insurance plans.


This plan would stabilize the finances of insurance plans covering the elderly
and narrow the financial gap between insurance plans.


The Welfare Ministry
estimates that the concept of sharing the burden would enable the public health
insurance plan to maintain operations with its annual premium income of about
90,000 yen a head in fiscal 2007 - without raising premiums.


Overall, this plan
would boost the government's share of contributions by 200 billion yen in fiscal
2007.


When company employees retire, they switch from corporate health insurance plans
to those run by municipal governments.


But when a patient aged 71 or older gets
medical treatment, an existing insurance plan for the elderly is applied, and
most of the payment is shouldered by various insurance societies, including
those run by companies and municipal governments.


That is why both plans call for abolishing the existing insurance scheme for the
elderly.


This is where top-up health insurance plans can be used.


The main difference between a top-up cover and a regular health insurance policy
is that top-up plans can be used only in case expenses incurred are beyond a
certain limit.


This limit, known as the deductible is decided beforehand and
premiums are calculated accordingly.


A top-up plan with a higher deductible has
a lower premium attached to it.


Another criterion is that a top-up plan normally works only on a single
incidence of hospitalisation.


This means that you can use the top-up plan only
if your medical bills exceed the deducible during a single hospitalisation by a
single member.


Now, let us assume you have taken a top-up insurance for Rs 5 lakhs with a
deductible of Rs 3 lakh.


You have an existing health insurance policy of Rs
3 lakhs and top-up insurance policy of Rs 5 lakh with a deductible of Rs 3 lakh.


When do top-up plans make sense?


Top-up plans are useful if you want to increase your health cover without paying
too much.


In the above example, if you think Rs 3 lakh is too low to cover the
fast-increasing healthcare costs, then top-up plans are a cheaper option than
buying a new policy or enhancing limit of the existing policy.


Further, if you
already have a health insurance policy, then do not buy a top-up plan which has
a deductible of more than the coverage from the existing plan.


For example, if
you have a health insurance policy with a cover of Rs 3 lakh, then do not buy a
top-up plan with a deductible greater than Rs 3 lakh.

Affordable Care Act plans carry added costs

BYLINE: David Bruce, Erie Times-News, Pa.


Getting health insurance is a goal for many patients of the clinic, which only
treats low-income Erie County residents who are uninsured.


"They came back due to the out-of-pocket deductibles they had to pay," said
Kelleher, the clinic's executive director.


The Affordable Care Act has been a godsend for many uninsured residents across
Erie County, offering health insurance plans with low monthly premiums --
especially if the person's income qualifies for tax credits.


But the out-of-pocket costs of some of these plans can exceed $6,000 a year --
far too much for someone on a limited income, Kelleher said.


"For some of them, it came down to paying their deductible or paying rent,"
Kelleher said.


The 63-year-old McKean Township man is satisfied with his current health
insurance, but was dismayed to learn his current Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield
plan will not be offered for 2016.


"Highmark sent me a letter telling me the new plan would have a lower premium,"
Murnock said.


Murnock worked with Robertson to select a different Highmark plan for 2016 that
costs about $70 a month more than his current plan, but covers more medical
costs.


"I can deal with the higher premium but if I was hospitalized and slammed with
all of those out-of-pocket costs, I would have to talk with the hospital about a
payment plan," Murnock said.

Gauging Health Insurance

Sept. 25--What should you look for in a health insurance policy?


Once upon a time, an employer-provided health insurance plan was almost always
the best option for couples and families.


Group plans were able to offer
affordable, broad coverage with low deductibles, and many employers paid a
substantial share of the premiums.


If both spouses are employed and both employers offer insurance, start by
comparing the two plans.


I suggest setting up a spreadsheet or chart to make it easier, and dig
into the details of each plan.


Compare the following:

* The specifics of what is covered and what is excluded

* Copays for office visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and
medications

* In-network and out-of-network costs

* Deductible amounts

* Annual out-of-pocket maximums

Also investigate each company's employee policies related to health insurance.


Ask
your current health insurance company for the explanation of benefits for the
past year, or go through your checkbook and list all your health care expenses.


If you travel a lot, for example, you may need to use out-of-network
health care more often.


Make sure the plans' networks include all your doctors, including specialists
like dermatologists as well as your family clinic.


Check out plans offered through your state's insurance exchange.


If you don't
qualify for subsidies, these plans may be more expensive than employer plans.


It is available to those covered by
health insurance plans with high deductibles (currently $1,300 for individuals
and $2,600 for families).


However, not all high-deductible plans are eligible
for HSAs.


Doing this much research before choosing a health insurance plan may seem
daunting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Howard Dean, a physician and former governor of Vermont, moved to broaden his
campaign for his party's 2004 presidential nomination Tuesday with a plan to
greatly expand health care to millions of Americans without insurance.


Dean said his plan would build on existing health care programs such as the
Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicaid and private employer-provided
health insurance, and eventually would cover all Americans younger than 25 and
most over that age.


His plan would echo similar programs he initiated in Vermont, where 96 percent
of children and 91 percent of adults now have health insurance.


Dean said his plan would cost about $88 billion a year.


Dean's campaign said his plan would cost considerably less than a proposal by
political rival Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., which would total $214 billion a
year.


Gephardt's plan has framed debate on the issue during the early stage of
the 2004 presidential campaign.


He said Dean's plan would not make health
insurance any more affordable, would do nothing to cut health care costs for
state and local governments, and would not cover all Americans without
insurance, even those who go without coverage only for part of each year.

NOTES: PROPOSAL TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE
Democrat Howard Dean's plan for national health insurance:
* Expand the current federal-state Children's Health Insurance Program to cover
low-income young adults up to age 24 and some low-income parents.


* Create a "Universal Health Benefits Program," modeled after insurance plans
available to Congress and federal employees.


The plan would be open to small
businesses and people who don't get insurance through their employers or who are
self-employed.


Its portfolio of products include whole-life plan, wealth
plan, education plan, level term plan, decreasing term plan, personal accident
plan, travel insurance plan, retirement plan, group life plan and group credit
life plan.


In addition, the company offers health insurance products, which
comprise individual and group health plans.


BUSINESS DESCRIPTION:



Takaful Emarat is a provider of takaful insurance products, based in the UAE.


The individual life insurance products include Al Moyassara plan,
wealth plan, whole-life plan, level term plan, education plan, retirement plan,

The corporate life insurance
plans offered by the company consist of group life and group credit life plans.


It offers individual health insurance and group
health insurance plans.


Furthermore, the company, in partnership with premium medical network providers,
provides access to an exclusive and wide range of medical network to its
customers.


It also plans to provide the mobile-friendly website for its
customers.


The marketplace is, in part, a website where health insurance
companies list the plans they will offer under the marketplace guidelines.Plans
through the marketplace are private health insurance plans.


In Oklahoma, you
generally have the option of buying a plan through one of five companies: Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, Coventry Health Care of Kansas, GlobalHealth,
Aetna or CommunityCare.These plans include health insurance coverage for

How do you sign up?You can look at plans available through the marketplace by
going to HealthCare.gov.


You can also enroll in a plan by calling (800)
318-2596, or (855) 889-4325 for text telephone (TTY).The website has a history
of being buggy, although federal officials have said the issues that the website
had when it initially opened in October have largely been resolved.


?re in prison.Depending on your income level, you might qualify for a
discount on your health insurance plan, known as a subsidy or premium tax
credit.


These credits are generally available to people who made a household
income between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.


?ll be asked about your income and likely told whether you
qualify for these benefits.In Oklahoma, if you earn less than 100 percent of the
federal poverty level, you generally do not qualify for a subsidy.

What plans are available?You can buy a bronze, silver, gold or platinum plan,
but keep in mind that cost is not the only factor you should consider.Bronze
plans will have the highest deductibles and other cost sharing.


For example, a
bronze plan might have a much higher deductible but be available for a lower
cost than a plan with a lower deductible.


A deductible is the amount of money
you have to pay for certain services before your health insurance company begins
to pay for those services.Platinum plans generally have the lowest deductibles,
co-pays and other cost sharing.


In general, plans with lower cost sharing will
have higher premiums, and vice versa.You might also be eligible to buy a
catastrophic plan, which has the highest deductible among marketplace plans.

Association at 601-9270 to find out more about finding resources to help you

McCain health plan could take coverage away, report says

LENGTH: 444 words


Nearly 100,000 working West Virginians would lose health insurance through their
employers under health-care plan proposed by John McCain's campaign, a new
report says.


Since the McCain plan would eliminate tax breaks for businesses that provide
health insurance to their employees, many businesses - especially small
businesses - would chose to drop health coverage as a fringe benefit, the report
from the Economic Policy Institute says.


Larry Matheney, secretary-treasurer of the West Virginia AFL-CIO, said McCain's
health plan "would eventually strip 99,125 West Virginia workers, currently
enrolled in employer based group plans, of their coverage and add them to the
rolls of the currently 250,000 uninsured West Virginians."


McCain's plan includes a $5,000 tax credit to help people pay for health
insurance, a sum they can deduct directly from their federal taxes.


Appearing on "This Week" hosted by George Stephanopoulos on Sept. 28, McCain
acknowledged his plan could lead to tax increases for people whose employers
provide health insurance for them today.


Since McCain's health-care reform plan would end this tax break for employers,
the EPI predicts as many as 27 million Americans nationwide could lose their
health insurance in the near future.

Jan. 3--HUDSON -- The American Medical Association is touring New Hampshire, as
the presidential primary draws nearer, to promote a three-point plan for
health-care reform that includes tax-funded coverage for the uninsured.


This part public, part private plan seeks first to provide health coverage to
the 47 million uninsured Americans through a voucher or tax credit program, and
then to reform the existing private system, AMA board member Dr. Joseph Annis
told The Telegraph editorial board Wednesday.


The reforms include ensuring all Americans have a choice of plans, and that
plans are portable -- meaning they can be transferred from state to state.


The AMA developed the plan along with 15 other national health-care
organizations, including AARP, the American Hospital Association and America's
Health Insurance Plans, an association of health insurance companies.


Annis said the group looked at other country's health plans but decided a public
health-care system would not work here because Americans value choice.


The first step in implementing that plan -- developing a voucher system that
subsidizes the cost of health insurance for those who can't afford it -- was
viewed as the least disruptive way to reform health care, he said.


The doctor said he could not pinpoint which primary candidate's health-insurance
plan is most aligned with the AMA's.


In the short term, Annis said the AMA encourages states to test various
health-care reform plans -- as Massachusetts did last year by requiring all
residents to have health insurance.

California: AB-2299 Developmental services: health insurance copayments.


Developmental services: health insurance

the consumer, as applicable, has an annual gross income that does not exceed
400% of the federal poverty level.


Existing law prohibits a regional center from

plan or health insurance policy of the consumer or his or her parent, guardian,
or caregiver.


The bill would also authorize a regional center to pay a

necessary to successfully maintain the child at home or the adult consumer in
the least-restrictive setting and specified conditions relating to the financial
need of the parent, caregiver, or consumer are satisfied.

Section 95000) of the Government Code) is paid for, in whole or in part, by the
health care service plan or health insurance policy of the consumer's parent,
guardian, or caregiver, the regional center may, when necessary to ensure that

parent, guardian, or caregiver to meet the care and supervision needs of the
child or impacts the ability of the parent, guardian, or caregiver, or adult
consumer with a health care service plan or health insurance policy, to pay the
copayment or coinsurance deductible.


(2) The existence of catastrophic loss that temporarily limits the ability to
pay of the parent, guardian, or caregiver, or adult consumer with a health care
service plan or health insurance policy and creates a direct economic impact on
the family or adult consumer.
